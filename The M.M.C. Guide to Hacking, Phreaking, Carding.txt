Guide to Hacking, Phreaking, Carding                                By: The Dark Lord  Introduction:  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      This is a text file is made by The Mickey Mouse Club and we ask that it would be distibuted to others for their use.  This file is going to go into depth on how to hack, phreak, and card.  There will be information that should help everyone, hopefully!!  Hacking: ~~~~~~~~~~      Hacking is a long hard process, unless you get lucky.  There are many programs and aids out to make the job a lot easier, but the concept is the same no matter how you use it.  First, at least on most things that you hack, you need to get some type of account or vacancy, etc...  This is done by randomly entering numbers and or letters until you come up with the proper combination to find the account.  Knowing the size of the account number makes this job one-hundred times easier.  Thats why I suggest you find out from someone who allready has one or card one.  By carding the account, it will die quickly but at least it will give you the length of the account numbers (More on that topic will be expained in the carding section).  The accound numbers, do not always just contain numbers or have numbers at all in it.  If it has a mix, it makes it a hell of a lot harder to get.  You will just have to experiment to find out what charactors are contained in the account.  Some Examples of ones that do have mixes of numbers and letters would be Pc Persuit accounts.  The forms of them are usuall as such:            Account: Pgp014764g            Password: 23632k     It looks from these that you are pretty much screw because of the way letters are mixed with numbers, thats what makes having a program so much easier.  In a lot of circumstances, getting the account is the hardest part that is why having a good background of the system is a major plus in your favor.     Once you have got the account, it is time to get the password for this account.  Once again having the length and such makes this process not only easier, but faster.  just keep entering random passwords of the length or the thought length in until you get a stoke of luck and get it.  You MUST remember that 99.5 out of 100 times, this is a long process, and you have to have patience.  If you don't you might as well forget ever getting on to the system or have someone else do it for you.  Once you have gotten the password, look it over long and hard.  Write it down and keep it, examine it.  99% of the time there is a pattern to all the account passwords.  Things to look at is the password in reference to the account number.  check to see if things have been added to the end or beginning like 00 or 01 or 99 of 0010 thing like that.  If you see no relations, the only other way to really find out the pattern in to get another one. Look at both of them together, see if there the same or it account 400's password is 3456 and 402's password is 3458 (they go in order) then just those as a reference to other passwords, take away so much from accounts with a lower number and add the required amounts to accounts with a higher number, etc....  But bassicly, LOOK FOR A PATTERN!  Once you have got the password and the account, you have got yourself a passage way in.     Although this is what you do to succeed, you have to take many precautions.  They do NOT like us messing with the system and they obviously want you to pay just like the others, so they will take necessary means to nail you.  They trace like you wouldn't belive.  They will trace right as you get on, if you happen to be unlucky, you will never know when they are doing it either, you must ALWAYS be aware of the dangers and take precautions!!!  Even on things that you wouldn't think that they would trace you but, be carfull.  Whether they trace depends on a couple of things, here are a few major ones:     1. There bank balance     2. There desire to catch you     3. The amount of infestation in there system    There are things that you can do to protect yourself, these are not all    of them and none of them are sure fire ways, but hey, cutting down your    chances of getting caught makes a world of difference, because remember,    All the fun is taken away if you caught.  Some things to do to protect    yourself is:     1. Use a diverter     2. Use false information about you     3. Never stay On-line too long     4. Call during late or early hours, were there is most likely no one     monitoring the system     5. Don't call frequently or during the same hours, regulate it    Once again these are not all of them but these are some of the "More" helpfull things.  If you follow all the step, you can reduce the change of getting caught by about 40%.    If you do get caught there is not a whole lot that you can do, but some tips are, first, don't reveal any information on what you have done. Deny all charges.  Sencond, plea bargin with knowladge of things, like hacked sytems etc..  But never admit that you did it.  Three, and most important, get a GOOD LAWYER!!!!!!! DIFFERENT TYPES OF SYSTEMS:    Pc Persuit     Cp\m    Trw    Unix    Vmb    Vms     These are just a few systems, if I made a complete list There would be pratically no end to it, there are millions. Phreaking:~~~~~~~~~~~~     Phreaking, Ahhhwwww, the wonderfull world of phreaking.  Well to start with Phreaking is "The use of Telecommunications to others besides people of the Phone Company".  Well thats my version of the definition at least.     Using codes is wuit easy, there are different parts to it, the Dial-up, the code, and the number.  First you will have to dial in the dial-up and on most dial ups you will get a tone or a buzz or click or something to that effect.  Once you hear this, and you will know when you hear it you dial in the code.  Sometime you will get another tone or beep etc. and when you do that is when you dial in the number.  If you do not get another tone or whatever you just dial in the number right after you enter the code. You might have to have a test dial up to see how the tones go.     In dialing the number once agian the nubers differ.  You must enter the area code and then the nuber.  Some require that you have a one before the area code but most that I have used do not.  You can tell if the code worked right after the number has been put in not just by the error recording that you get but if right off the bat the phone begins to ring, it doesn't work.     A code can also be busy.  If it is busy it could mean that the code is dead or that too many people are using it at once.  You might experiance this often.     There are numbers that make phreaking much safer, they are called diverters.  What the do is when the number that you have dial is being traced it diverts it to that number.  Unless this is virgin or nobody else uses it, you will find that with in a couple of days after it is out, it will be busy, that is the annoyance about diverters, and they are also hard to get.     Hacking is also put into play in phreaking by using programs to get dial ups and the codes.  Getting these are done in the same way you hack anything else.   Just get a program like code thief or code hacker, or make one yourself, it is quite easy.     There is a danger with useing the codes.  If you hack a code yourself, not just the code but the dial up amd no one else has it you can pretty well bet that it is safe.  A newly hacked dial-up/code is considered "Virgin". those Ma bell is not having the problem with people phreaking off of it so they don't bother doing anything with it.  But after a while, it will either Die (No Longer work) or they will start tracing off of it.  The whole pain about it is, is you will never positively no when they started doing traces or things like that.  The codes might be being traced but you are getting the luck of the draw.  On most codes they don't trace on every call, they just file it away and watch for like the 50th or 100th caller and then that person gets nailed.  You might think if they do trace every 100 calls, that means you have a 1 in 100 chance of getting caught and those are really good odds.  Well the odd is 100 to 1 but the is a lot of people that live in areas that they can call with that code.  If you figure about 10 million people could use it then about 100,000 of them are.  100,000, hummmmmmm, how odes your odds look now.  In a couple minute time spand 99 peoplecould have used it, and lucky you might be the 100th caller.  A lot of times the take like every hundered calls and then when they get the 100th caller, that don't just trace one, they trace 100, 101, 102, 103, 104 200, 201, 202 etc.  So you chances of getting caught when the heat is on the code is pretty good.  There are a couple different types of codes and the two major ones are 1-800's and 950's.  800's can pretty much be dialed from anywhere in the states, but 950's stay in certain areas.  Some 950 dial ups are:    9501001    9500266    9500355    9501388     And there are others, but like take me for example, where I live you cannot use 9500266.  It will tell you that you cannot use that number from your dialing range or it just won't work.  You might get to the point where the dial-up works but not the code.  If this is the case it will say:             "Invalid authorization Code"     Some examples of 1-800's are as follows:     1-800-255-2255     1-800-759-2345     1-800-959-8255     There are many others but those are just a few, very few.  There are also 1-800's and others that will send you directly to the operator, you must tell her the code and the number you are dialing.  These are NEVER safe to use.  but in one case they are alot better.  I am out of town a lot so I have to use pay phones right?  Well, you are safe with anything with pay phones, so that is a good way to call people.  The real good thing them though, is since you must go throught th operator, the codes stay valid for up to 10 times as long as the others.  But thenm again another draw back is it is not a line that you want to give real names or numbers over. Because these are often tapped, since the operator know that you used the code, they will listen in quite often, and you will never even notice. Another problem experianced with them is if you are what MMC calls                          "Petite Flowers", our home made word for, someone that sounds like a little kid, then they really give you a hastle about using the code.     I have had a lot of people ask me if the person you are calling with the codes can get busted.  The answer is "No".  They cannot do anything to the person, just ask him who is calling him with the codes, and they rarely do that.  Just let the person you are talking to, if they don't already know, not to tell anyone that you are calling with the codes.  The phone companies do have to option of setting up a trace on that persons line and bust you when you do call him with a code.  I have never seen this done but do be aware that the phone companies are made up of intellegent adults and they are very smart and can and will nail you in many ways.     I am a firm beliver that you should share a the information that you other phreakers and hackers as they should do the same with you.  I also see an execption, inexperianced people.  They can run it for everyone be not have the knowladge and screwing up.  I realize that they need someway to build themselves up to a good phreaker but be cautions in what you give to them.     Codes die really often and you really have to keep up with the phone company.  Its kinda of a pain to keep up with it on your own as quickly as they work but thats why there is phreaking communities and groups such as Fhp and MMC, the gives the edge to the phreakers in the way that, you have help in keeping up with the phone companies, and in most cases if the groups or communities are working well together, you can eve stay one step ahead of good 'ole Ma bell and others.  You really need to find ways of getting codes either from getting acess to the phreaking sections on the pirate boards you call or throught friends, Vmb's Loops, Confrences, etc., just try to find a good connection to people that are into phreaking too. Carding:~~~~~~~~~~     Although everything talked about in the text file to this point is illegal, and you will get busted if you get caught, this is one one the one that you can get in some major shit over.  About the only thing I have talked about that this falls short of is hacking a government compter, and thats one of the Grand daddies of them all.  Well, although it is a major crime, it is really cool!!!!  This is the process in which you find the card number of someone and use it to purchase things.  In order to card, there are a few things that you must have or it will not work.  You will need to have........     1. The Card Number     2. The Experation date     3. Card type (Master Card, Visa, etc...) Those are the main things tha you will need.  Having the name of the owner is very helpfull but it is not a must.  You can get by without it.     You have to order everything you want by mail.  A couple of "Beginner" carder that I talked to didn't understand how you would do it, but thats when they had the misconception that you actually go to the store and purchase things.  That is a complete No, no.  You do everything from a phone ordering service.       When you call make sure that you are a t a pay phone.  Don't do it your house or anywhere where it can come back to you.  When you order the merchandice, once again do send it to anywhere that it can come back to you like your home, work, etc.  Find a vacant house or building or anywhere else that you can send it to.  Also, don't send it to a P.O. box that you have, just as dangerous.  When you do order it and you think its around the time that you will be reciving it, check the mailbox frequently.  But do it during odd hours.  I mean, hows it going to look you taking a package from a vacant house?       Most bills are sent at the end of the month or at the biginning, so try to time it to where the bill won't come to the person untill a couple of days after you have recived the package.  Ok heres how to figure it.  I have found out that the bills are sent out up around the 26-30th of the month, so they will actually recive the bill around the 31-4th.  Have it sent right after you think the bill has been sent.  Find what you want, but try to order it from the place that guarentees the fastest delivery.  When you order the item, make sure they have it in stock and don't have to get the item in first.  Order the highest class of delivery but not COD or next day service.  Thats cutting it too close.  It should take around 2-4 weeks before you get it and if you timed it right, then it sound get there right before the person gets the bill.  You need to have it in your possesion before the bill gets to the person because if they complain, they can keep it from being sent, or watch who actually gets it even while its going throught the mail process.  Don't order more than a couple of things or overcharge the card, if the people at the Credit card office, see irregular charging on the card, they will follow up on it.         To actually order the item you will call up the place that you will be ordering from, and when the operator answers let her know what you need to as far as what you are purchasing, etc.  When she ask how you will be paying just tell her "Charge" and the the type of card like Master Card, Visa, ect.  Then Tell them your name, if you don't know the name of the actuall owner of the card, Make up a false name that has NO relation to your name, not the same first, last middle what ever, nothing relating to your real name.  Then continue answering all the operators questions, address (Not your own remember!) state, area code etc.  They will also ask for your phone number.  Make one up, not your own.  If something happens to go wrong as far as delivery or if they are checking if you are who you say, then your screwed, unless of course, hehehe, the number is ALWAYS busy.  Find the busiest number there is and leave them that.  When they ask for the card number and experation, just tell them and do what all else you need.  Wish them a good day, and hope you get it.         Ok heres how you check if the card is good, and how much money can be charged on the card.......     1. Dail 1-800-554-2265     2. it will ask for the type of the card.  you must put in 10 for Master Card and 20 for Visa, I am not sure about the others.     3. Next it will ask for the Identification.  You will need to enter 1067     4. After all that you will have to enter the Mecrchant number, which you will either need to put in 24 or 52.  One of them should work.     5. You will then have to enter (When Prompted) the card number itself.     6. Next, the experation date of the card.     7. Last but not least the amount you want to try to get on the card. The procedure for this is enter dollars, astricks, then cents.     (Example:)         100*30 = One hundred dollars and thirty cents. One thing I do need to mention, after you type in everything you must press pound (#).  Like when it asks you for the type of card, if you had a Master Card you would put:  10#.  when it asked for identification you would enter 1067#.  If it says invalid, that either means that the card is no good or you can't charge that amount on the card.  Try it again, but try a lower amount.  If you get down to $1 and it still doesn't work, hehehe, you can probably guess that the card is no good.     You might not be ordering just merchandice you might be ordering accounts and things like that and if you are, fine, but you have to remember, the accounts do not stay good for very long, the owner of the card gets the bill, complains and its no longer any good.  And when you card and account, Nine out of ten times, they won't kill the account, they will trace in and that is when you butts really in a sling.  So carding accounts and things, isn't the safest way to go, of course. nothing we have talked about it, right? Conclusion:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Well thats about it for now, there should be a BIG newsletter by The Mickey Mouse Club comming out soon that you have to be sure NOT to miss. I sincerely hope that you have gotten alot out of this file and I would like to ask for suggestions and ideas to make MMC a better orginazation.  At this time myself and Cardiac Arresst have a VMB at:                1-800-444-7207 [Ext] 4001.     All ideas and suggestions, please bring there.  Also, since your making the trip anyways, bring along some phreaking codes and all and any types of accounts.  I would be greatly appreciated by:    The Mickey Mouse Club.    09/89-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  <=þ=> <=þ=> <=þ lääChäë ŸçíM: ’lÅäçï’Åiûä ï’Åiíï [áälGiUM] þ=> <=þ=> <=þ=>
