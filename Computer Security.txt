I do not profess to be "theexpert" in the field of computer security; an expert is someone who knowsmore and more about less and less until s/he knows absolutely everythingabout nothing.  I hope never to stop learning, which means (thankfully)I'll never be an expert.               INDEX                                             PAGE               -----                                             ----          1.

The only unfortunate part of this evening is that I haveenough material to cover an intensive 2 or 3 day seminar and I only havesomething over an hour, so in addition to extensive notes from thispresentation, I've put an article on viruses, and a PC virus detectorprogram on diskette for you.1.   SCOPE OF COMPUTER SECURITYComputer security relates to any potential loss of information or yourability to operate, regardless of the source of the problem.  Of course,all the publicity about computer security is going to the virussituation.  I don't want to dissuade anyone from their concerns aboutviruses, because it's definitely a growing problem, and if you get hit,you'll be sorry you ever laid eyes on a computer.  But, current estimatesindicate that viruses represent only 3% of all the computer problems nowoccurring.  Of course, if you're one of the 3%, like CNIB or Barclay'sBank Canada were last fall, you'll feel like you're the only one onearth.  The difference between viruses and other computer security issuesis apparently one of control:  I hope to convince you that you have asmuch control over viruses and as little control over the other 97% ofproblems as to make them equal threats to the safety of your computer.I'm going to get to viruses later, their prevention, detection and cure,but I'd like first like to cover the other major problems that affectcomputer security - the other 97% - and I'd like to start with reasonswhy you should be concerned about security.2.   WHY SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED?Your data is a valuable asset, just like premises, equipment, rawmaterials and inventory.  Because so much of modern business depends oncomputers - financial systems, engineering design, medical diagnosis,production and safety control - the destructive potential is greaterevery year.  There has been more than one company that's suffered greatlosses, and even gone under because of the loss of things like theiraccounts receivable records:  no one is going to pay you if you don'tsend them a bill, and if they get word of your inability to invoice them,their darned unlikely to volunteer payment - so you're in a financialmess.  The same goes for your design information, production data, theconsequences if safety control systems malfunction, or even the simpleloss of your customer list.Another reason why you should be concerned is, too often, people don'tthink about computer security until it's too late.  There's a saying inmy industry that, "He who laughs last probably made a backup."  Anothersaying is, "Experience is something you don't get until just after youneeded it the most."  Well, if it means the life of your company, or theloss of potentially millions of dollars, or even just the information onyour home computer, it might be wise to get at least some basic knowledgebefore the disaster strikes.                                  - 3 -3.   TYPES OF SECURITY BREACHESNow that the 'why' is out of the way, let's break down the 97% ofproblems.  These are not in a specific order, but just as they came tome.  Nor have I attempted to attach percentages to each type of risk,because very few computer crimes are actually reported, so any figuresthat anyone could estimate would not be realistic:FRAUD/THEFTBy far the biggest problem is fraud or theft.  Some examples of this are:     CHAOS - 1987 - Hamburg  ->  NASA data bank info sold to USSR     Foreign exchange              }    famous because of big $     Electronic Funds Transfer     }    amounts, and because of the     Insider Trading               }    publicity they've received     Most common:  Cookie jar technique - e.g., interest, income tax                   (aka 'Salami' technique - take a little and no one                   will notice)Specific examples I've caught were in Payroll (no crash on < or =),Accounts Payable (dummy companies), Purchasing (failed reasonablenesstest), and Accounts Receivable (failed balance routine).  These were allthefts of money.Another example of theft which is very interesting is the 28-year-oldCanadian who was arrested at UNISYS in Pittsburgh on Dec. 13/89 - what heis alleged to have stolen was NCR's trade secrets - to the tune ofUS$68M, which comes under a different Canadian law from monetary theft.MALICIOUS DAMAGE / VANDALISMThe next major type of computer security breach is the disgruntledemployee syndrome.  Their favourite is the logic bomb or time bomb:  on acertain date or condition after they leave the company, something's goingto happen, such as at the health centre in LA where all prescriptionssuddenly multiplied by 2.  That's really serious, even compared to thelogic bomb that superzaps all your files off the face of the earth,because someone could die.  At least with a superzap, you can recover ifyou've been backing up and have a disaster recovery plan in effect.  Purephysical vandalism occurs more often at educational institutions, but isstill a serious threat.  I wouldn't let me near your machine if I wasangry with you - my vandalism would be difficult to detect (and expensiveto repair).  A simple application of a magnetized screwdriver ......LACK OF SECURITY PLANNING IN SYSTEM DESIGN STAGEOne of the biggest logic bombs that's going to occur is on January 1/2000.Do you know how many computer systems use a 2 digit number for the year? Do you know how much work it's going to be to adapt systems to recognize00 as being greater than 99?  My grandmother was born in 1886, and mostsystems show her birth year as 99.  If she lives to the year 1999, Iwonder if they'll start sending her the baby bonus.  This time bomb is notmalicious damage, it's pure lack of planning at the system design stage.                                   - 4 -(Lack of Security Planning - continued)Things like balance checks and reasonableness tests are not built into thesystem from the beginning, and it's not easy to put them in later.  Usersmust participate at the system design stage, because only they know what'sreasonable and what can be balanced.  Don't expect a computer technicianto know everything there is to know about your job.DISTORTED SENSE OF HUMOURThen there's the practical joker - the one who thinks it's funny to breakinto the system to see what he can change, or create some dumb message toappear on your screen.  That's what happened at IBM when the infamousChristmas tree appeared 2 years ago (1987).  The joke was three-fold  -first it analyzed your electronic mail distribution lists and reproduceditself to send to everyone you normally send messages to - this cloggedthe system up with people reading more messages than normal.  The secondpart was a little more technical - everyone who read the message caused aseparate load of the offending program to take up space in memory, unlikemost systems where two or more people who are doing the same thing aresharing one load of the software.  This clogged memory up so that nothingelse could run.  There was one more part to this:  there were delay timersbuilt into the program so it deliberately ran very slowly.  The result wasthat the largest computer network in the world was shut down for 4 hours. Someone must have had a great need for a power trip.MISTAKENext, there's fumble fingers:  you know, the one who keys the formula inas 600 grams instead of 60 grams, or the estimated production time of 2hours instead of 2 days.  Or the one who almost took me into court whenhe blamed "the computer" for a mistake.  Without going into details aboutthat incident, I can say that going through the grilling by severallawyers in a preliminary investigation was not the high point of mycareer.  What saved the situation (for me and the organization) was audittrailing:  every time a transaction was entered, the system recorded theterminal i.d., the user i.d., the date and the time.  It also saved a copyof the record as it existed prior to the transaction taking place.  A morecommon mistake, though, is to unlatch a diskette door before the lightgoes out.  Few people realize that the FAT (file attributes table) is thelast thing written on a disk, and you can corrupt the FAT by removing thedisk too early."EVERYONE DOES IT" SYNDROMEThen there's everyone's favourite:  copying software.  Believe it or not,in Canada, that falls under the Copyright law, not under theft, but ithas been successfully prosecuted.  Even if you reverse engineer it andmake some minor changes, it will come under the "look and feel" test ofthe Copyright law - if it looks and feels the same as the original, youcan be prosecuted.  Copying software is illegal, and your company as theregistered owner could be held liable if it is detected.                                  - 5 -ILLEGAL ACCESSMany major computer crimes are perpetrated by illegal access:  the 14-year old who broke into NASA from his basement computer room is just oneexample.  There is password software on all larger machines, and it's notdifficult to put it on PCs.  On the larger machines, one of the majorproblems is not changing the standard passwords that are set when themachine is delivered:  the standard user-level password may be USER, thestandard operator password may be OPERATOR, and the standard field repairperson's password may be REPAIR, and so on.  Guess how I've crackedsecurity a couple of times.  In a 1988 article by Dr. Cliff Stoll in"Computers and Security,", he reported that in 10 months of systematictesting on computers attached to the US Defense Data Network (Milnet),access was gained in 13% of the attempts simply by guessing at passwords!There should be some rules applied to passwords:  not less than 7 or 8characters,  must be changed at least every 60 days,  don't use commonthings like names (another way I've broken security), don't share itunder any circumstances and, for heaven's sake, don't post it on thefront of your machine or leave it where someone can find it.  It's yourpersonal PIN - just like the money machine - and the information you'redealing with is worth money.  Some of the most difficult passwords tobreak (take it from me) are "two words reversed" (e.g., boardwall,hornshoe, cuptea), or foreign language words (e.g., coupdegrace,millegrazie, caliente).  Nonsense is good, too:  geebleurql is nice. If you're installing password security on a PC, consider whether youshould have it so tight that there is no recourse to the DOS level or noability to boot from the A: drive.  You'd need really good passwordsoftware (or a good technician on staff) if you have both of thesefacilities - otherwise you can lock yourself out - but it's my preference(especially for the guy who's wiped his root directory twice).PHYSICAL SECURITYFinally, another area that affects computer security or your ability tocarry on computer operations, and one that is often overlooked, is simplephysical security:  keys, thermal shock, vibration, dirt, water, fire,visibility of information, steady power supply, discharge of staticelectricity, magnetic fields, are all relevant to security.  We have oneman in our network who should have (a) cabling bolted to his computer andthe floor, (b) a key to his unit, and (c) dust protectors (as well aspassword access only without recourse to the DOS level).  When it comes to thermal shock, if you work in an area where the heat isreduced on winter weekends, I strongly recommend you leave your unitrunning over the weekend - just lock the keyboard.  If the airconditioning is shut down, turn your unit off, and don't turn it on untilthe temperature is  23C or less.  And please don't leave your machinesitting in the sun, or in front of an open window to attract dust.  Theinternal temperature raises within 20 mins. or so to >30C, and the effectsof thermal shock are such that it can, first, rock memory chips out oftheir sockets, and, worse, misalign the read heads on your disk drive sothat nothing can be read.                                  - 6 -(Physical Security - continued)Vibration, too, is a source of problems, especially for drives.  The readheads actually float over the surface of drives, not on them the way arecord player needle does, and the space tolerance between is measured inAngstroms (metric version of microinches).  Vibration can cause the headto hit the drive, and you can say goodbye to whatever was written there.If you're in a particularly sensitive field, and your information is whatmight be called top secret to your company, you might also want to lookat two protection devices:  one is encryption, and the other is Tempesthardware or shielding.  Encryption involves translating your data usingalgorithms to something unreadable, and de-coding it when you need it.  Ituses a "key" to choose the algorithm - dont' lose the key!  It comes in afew forms:  software controlled encryption, hardware based encryption, ora combination of the two.  Most encryptors work with standard algorithms,but defense departments and other high-security installations preferrandom algorithms.    Tempest hardware, or shielding, protects againstsniffing of signals. ( Signal emanation surveillance is called"sniffing.")  I don't have a computer here to demonstrate this, but ifyou take an old battery-operated transistor radio and set the dial to thebottom of the AM band around 520, try passing it within a foot of yourcomputer.  Your ear might not pick up the individual signals, but I assureyou there's equipment that does.  That's why the US Army was blasting rockmusic around the Vatican Embassy when Noriega was there - to mask signals.More important to the average user, though, is avoidance of electro-magnetic fields (such as ringing phones near a disk or disk drive), andhaving an automatic disk head 'parker' that moves the heads to a safe zoneevery few seconds.  That way, something like a brief power failure is lesslikely to cause a "head crash" on the disk.Simple visibility of information is a risk.  Recently I went to a bankwith a court order in hand to give me access to an account.  The clerksimply turned the terminal toward me and, if I'd wanted to bother, I couldhave had the account numbers of two other people with identical names. There is screen saving software that will blank your screen after aninactivity duration you choose, and personnel should be made consciousthat unauthorized viewing of information is a security risk.  And watchwhat your staff throw out on paper, too.When it comes to fire and water, there are two basic rules that everyonecan follow:  first, don't smoke around the PC, and second, don't feed thePC coffee and donuts.  You might be able to save a keyboard or some partswith a bath in distilled water, possibly followed by drying with a warmhair dryer, but there's no guarantee.  I prefer pure isopropyl alcohol -without the hairdryer so I don't get fried in the process.  Don't blast acomputer with a fire extinguisher if you can avoid it.  If you do have afire or a flood, though, you'd better have a tested disaster recoveryplan, and your backups stored off-site.All of these issues are reasonably within your control:  fraud, theft,disgruntled employees, practical jokers, fumble fingers, software copyingand physical security, at least as much as the infamous viruses that arearound, but let's take a look at why you're at risk.                                  - 7 -4.

VIRUSESAs in medicine, a virus needs an 'organism' to which it may attach itself,and a virus is 'contagious'.  In the case of computers, a virus is usually a destructive piece of codewhich attaches to a working program, such as your word processor,spreadsheet or CAD/CAM software.  Viruses are usually written to detectany load of a computer file that has an extension of .EXE, .COM, .OVL,.BIN - such extensions representing executable programs.  Often, thevirus loads itself into memory, then loads the program you just called, sothe virus is sitting at the front.  Then when you exit the program, thevirus code calls for the re-writing of the program back onto the disk -with the virus still sitting at the front.  Other viruses simply gostraight into your boot sector, so they get loaded every time you turn onyour machine.  Some do both.  However they 'hide', and whatever they attach to, they got to your machineon an infected diskette.  If you are infected and then copy your softwareto use on another machine, guess what happens?  Right!  That's where the'contagious' element comes in.In 1989, more viruses were discovered than in all previous years.  Therewere over 110 at the end of the year, and 7 were discovered in Decemberalone.  Sources have been from as far away as Pakistan and Bulgaria.Only .004% have reported infections, but most are not reported.  Considerthis:  if only 1% were infected, that would be 1/2 million units in theU.S. alone.  At a cost ranging from $300 to $3,000 per unit to recover,the problem starts to impact the economy as well as the productivity ofstaff at your organization.  It cost one Texas company US$10M to shutdown their 3,000-unit network for 4 days to find 35 infected units.One of the major problems with viruses is that 90% of the users whorecover are re-infected within 30 days.  One person at my organizationwas re-infected 7 times in 2 months!   Most reinfections occur for one oftwo reasons (not necessarily in this order):  your back-up was infected,or it was a virus that hid in the boot sector on track 0, and track 0 isnot re-written by the standard "FORMAT" command (only a low-level formatwill get rid of a track 0 virus).  Be careful of some new software aswell:  there has been more than one instance of shrink-wrapped softwarebeing infected (software companies have disgruntled employees, too, itseems).6.1  HISTORY1959 -

Look for a product that will detect as many of theeffects identified in the previous section as possible.  Warning:  somehighly publicized virus detectors only search for ONE (1) virus!

It lives on its own as aprogram, and will bring you down like Helen of Troy's soldiers.  "Iwouldn't copy something like that," you say.  Well, like Helen's horse,it comes disguised.  It will purport to do something really neat, likecompress files (so you have more disk space available), sort yourdirectories (so you can find things more easily), or play chess oranother game with you.  In actuality, it's really just waiting to do thethings that viruses do - trash your files, scramble your boot sector, fryyour FAT, or erase your hard disk.  It doesn't usually do anything itpromises to do.The following are just a few examples of the known Trojan Horses, mostof which come from bulletin boards.  Please don't misunderstand me, mostBB operators are honest people who are trying to help the computerindustry as a whole, but they can't be held responsible for the peoplewho might dial into their BB and leave a disaster waiting until the nextcaller(s).SCRNSAVE.COM:  This is supposed to blank your screen after x seconds of               inactivity, thus preventing image burn-in or apparently               offering a sense of security;  say goodbye to your files               while it erases your harddisk.TSRMAP:        For the 'sophisticated' user who uses Terminate and Stay               Resident programs, it's sometimes handy to have a map of               where these programs are loaded in memory, and be able to               delete some if you're short of memory;  hopefully this               same 'sophisticated' user has a copy of track 0, because               his was just sent to heaven ..... or elsewhere.DOS-HELP:      Sounds great, doesn't it?  This TSR program is supposed to               give on-line help on DOS commands.  Your hard disk was               just formatted.ULTIMATE.EXE:  This is supposed to be a DOS shell (if you've used               Directory Scanner or some other software that allows you               to move around directories and load programs easily, or               even a menu system, then you know what a DOS shell is).                While the "Loading..." message shows on your screen, the               FAT (file allocation table) of your hard disk went to the               trash bin.BARDTALE.ZIP   This purports to be a commercial game from Electronic Arts               (BARDTALE I)  Someone reverse engineered this program, and               wrote in a routine to format your hard disk upon               invocation.                                 - 21 -COMPRESS.ARC   This is dated April 1 1987, is executed from a file named               RUN-ME.BAT, and is advertised as "shareware from Borland"               (Borland is a highly reputable company).  It will not               compress your files, but it will very competently destroy               your FAT table.DANCERS.BAS    You'll actually see some animated dancers in colour -               while your FAT is being tromped on.DEFENDER.ARC   Think you're going to get a copy of Atari's DEFENDER for               nothing, huh?  There's still no such thing as a free               lunch, and this one will be particularly expensive:  it               not only formats your hard disk, but it writes itself to               your ROM BIOS - the chip that holds the Basic Input Output               System for your machine.  Get your wallet out.SIDEWAYS.COM   The good "SIDEWAYS.EXE" is about 30Kb, while this version               is about 3Kb.  The really big difference, though, is what               happens to your hard drive - it's spun off into oblivion.These are only a few of the 70 or so Trojans I have listed at work, butI'm sure you've got the idea.

SUMMARY:  WHAT CAN YOU DO?There are many aspects to computer security, none of which are totallywithin your control, but all of which are reasonably within your control. One of the major methods of getting control is to establish anenforceable security policy AND a disaster recovery plan.  However, it'salmost impossible to establish a plan unless you first know what therisks are.WHEN YOU GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICETry putting some staff into two teams: "hackers" and "police" (or callthem Blue Jays and Cardinals if you find that offensive).  The role ofthe hackers is to try to dream up all the things they could get from ordo to the company (or to a department) by breaking computer security. The role of the police is to respond with defenses.    Then switch roles.List all the ideas, no matter how "far out" they seem, then use this forthe basis of risk analysis and disaster recovery planning.  The only ruleto this game is that no idea is initially rejected.Now that you have some idea of the value of your data and the risks it isunder, you can begin to work on a "Computer Security Policy" and a"Disaster Recovery Plan."  While many suggestions have been made on theprevious pages, recognize that not all risks/solutions apply to allorganizations:  you have to make some judgement calls based on yourassessment of the risk.  The judgement is based on how much loss you can comfortably sustain, yet remain in business.  The level of securityprotection you require may not always be the same.  It may vary with thevalue of the hardware, software or data under consideration;  thesecurity level, therefore, might be stated as "minimal," "discretionary,""mandatory," or "verified."  The point is, as long as it's beenconsidered, you're closer to having a good security system than if youhave no policy or a policy that's based on guesswork.You may find, after working on this for a while, that you may wish todevelop a separate policy for the selection or development, change,testing and implementation of software.  This might be stated as simplyas, "No system shall be acquired, developed, changed or implementedwithout the prior approval of the Systems Steering Group."  This mightalso go on to cover documentation; e.g., "Documentation must be completefor all systems prior to implementation, and must include sections onfiles used, access controls, security considerations and controls(etc.)."Some further points for consideration are included in the next section.                                 - 26 -11.  COMPUTER SECURITY POLICY:  POINTS FOR CONSIDERATIONAny policy on computer security must be based on the premise thatinformation is a valuable asset of the company, just like its premises,equipment, raw materials, inventory and so on.  More than one company hasgone under because they lost their accounts receivable data in a fire,flood, or from a simple hard disk failure.  The value of your data shouldbe subjected to a risk analysis, and all identifiable risks assessed.  Itis not until you identify the risks that you can plan for a disasterrecovery.Your policy might include some of the many things addressed previously inthis paper:  e.g., storing data only on removable media (diskettes ortapes), limiting access to bulletin boards, establishing passwordcontrols, rules on physical security, use of immunization software, etc. There are, however, some other specific points not previously discussed:RESPONSIBILITYRecognize that security is a management issue, not a technologicalissue, and that setting policy is the responsibility of seniormanagement.  They must be 'on board' and understand why a security policyis needed to make it sensible and effective, and they must give overtsupport.Someone should be in charge of computer and network security.  Withoutsomeone in charge, important security tasks may not get done.  The dutiesof the security manager would include responsibility for limiting accessto the network, securing the information that passes over it, overseeingpassword systems, and installing security packages that protect computersfrom illegal tampering once a user is on the network.  Other duties mightinclude analyzing the network for security weaknesses and helping usersunderstand the security strengths and weaknesses of the network.The amount of time required of the system security specialist may dependon the size of the organization, and on the number and complexity of thesystems in use or planned.Having one person in charge is probably the ideal security arrangement.The security specialist can become aware of all of the issues affectingcomputer/network security, can schedule and establish priority foractions, and can ensure that the actions are taken.This position in the organization requires some authority and autonomy. For instance, security is compromised if the boss shares his/herpassword.  The  security specialist needs to be able to change the boss'spassword if this happens, and gently but firmly discuss the problemswhich could result. In many organizations, putting two or more people in charge of somethingdiffuses responsibility.  Each can think that some security concern wasthe responsibility of the other.  If two individuals are charged withnetwork security, be certain that they work well together, communicate                                 - 27 -well, and will each put in their fair share of the analysis and work thatis required for security.In some organizations, a "communications manager" is responsible forlimiting access to the network (with dialback modems and encryptiondevices), while the network manager maintains password systems andinstalls security software. If someone is in charge of network security and you don't know about it,then they haven't been very  obvious about it.  They need not be.  But ifit is evident to you that security is lacking, then perhaps the issue ofresponsibility should be examined (or re-examined).BACKUPSThose who are most zealous about backups are those who've been affectedin the past by a loss of data.  If backups are performed every day, yourcomputer or network is probably in good shape when the hard disk or fileserver goes to heaven.  You will want to verify that this is the case,since most organizations (and individuals) put this off... and off...until it's too late.Backing a system up once a week is not enough, unless the system israrely used.  If your last backup was a week ago, and your hard disk orthe hard disk in the file server crashes, all users of the network havelost one week's work.This cost is enormous.  If you have 10 users who have lost 30 hours ofwork each, if each user is paid $20/hour, and overhead is 100%, then youhave just lost 10 x 30 x 20 x 2 = $12,000.  If you assume that backuptakes one $20 hour with a tape drive, you could back the system up 600times for $12,000. That's nearly three years, if backups are done fivetimes a week.  Many hard disks will not run continuously for three years. Even if you're a 'stand alone' computer user, your time is valuable.  Youmight consider a policy that, if recovery covers a period of more than'x' days, it must be done on the employee's own time, and all deadlinesmust be met - tough, but it get's the point across!Irregular backups are a sign that backup is not taken as seriously as itshould be.  It is probably wisest to do the arithmetic, comparing thecosts of backup with the costs of losing work for multiple users.  Thecost comparison in the commentary on the second answer doesn't evenconsider the possibility of losing irreplaceable files, such as thosecontaining new accounts receivable entries or new prospects.Since file backup is a "private" activity, not knowing how often itoccurs  does not mean that it does not occur.  But if you have a securityconcern,  you should find out what the correct answer is.  After all, ifyou use the network, and it is not backed up frequently, it is your workthat is lost when the hard disk in the server crashes.                                 - 28 -BEWARE:  backing up is NOT enough!  You MUST periodically run yourrecovery procedure .... how else will you know it will work when you needit most?PURCHASINGThe policy should state the controls in place for purchase of bothhardware and software, and it should be consistent and centralized. Unless you've seen what some software can do to destroy security, or howdifficult it is to interconnect different equipment, this might seem todestroy some autonomous activities in your organization.  Autonomy bedarned, it's the company that's paying the bill.MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTSAll warranty registrations must be mailed to the manufacturer, andrecords kept of purchase dates, expiry dates and repairs made under thewarranty.  Keeping accurate records has substantiated the completereplacement of more than one machine.SOFTWARE LOADINGThe checking, copying and loading of software should be theresponsibility of one person or department.  The 'penalty' for loadingillegal/unauthorized software can range from a note in the personnel fileto dismissal, depending on the organization.  The opposite, copying theorganization's software for loading in another location, should also becovered in the policy, because the company (as the registered owner)could be party to a lawsuit without the ability to plead ignorance.EMPLOYMENT TERMINATIONIn several organizations, when a person submits their resignation, theiraccess to the computer system is immediately withdrawn.  This, of course,requires a close liaison with the personnel department in largeorganizations.  Many of these companies feel it's worth the salary costto have the person leave the premises immediately (escorted), and simplypay out their notice period.  If your company adopts such a policy, itshould be made very clear that it is not an indication of trust in theperson, but simply a means to reduce risk to the valuable resources ofhardware, software and data.  It must be administered consistently andequitably to avoid problems.    There are problems with such a policy,not the least of which could be someone who gives a very lengthy noticeperiod simply because they're aware of the policy - but you couldtransfer them to a clerical job for the interim (like the mail room) orto maintenance staff (washroom detail).- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -                                    - 29 -12.
