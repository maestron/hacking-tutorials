Cant See Secure Sites

Fix the problem with seeing them secrue sites (banks or online stores) i found this very usefull to me at my work (isp backbone support lol, at the time i was regular support  )

Any way... what u need to do is make a new notepad file and write in it the followng DLL's.. just copy-paste these



regsvr32 SOFTPUB.DLL
regsvr32 WINTRUST.DLL
regsvr32 INITPKI.DLL
regsvr32 dssenh.dll
regsvr32 Rsaenh.dll
regsvr32 gpkcsp.dll
regsvr32 sccbase.dll
regsvr32 slbcsp.dll
regsvr32 Cryptdlg.dll


and save it as > all file types, and make it something like securefix.bat.

then just run the file and ur problem shuld be gone.
