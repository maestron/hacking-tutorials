An ivalid ID and/or pw was entered.This means nothing.                  In UNIX there is no way guessing valid user IDs.You may                       come across this one when trying to get in.No more logins - will happens when the system wont accept anymore logins                 could be going down            Unknown Id - will happen if an ivalid id is entered using (su) commandUnexpected eof in file - The file being stripped file has been damagedYour password has expired - This is quiet rare although there have been cases                            where it happened.Reading the etc/passwd will                            show you at how many intervals it changes.You may not change the password - The password has not yet aged enough.The                                  Administrator set the quotas for the usersUnknown group [groups name] - occurs when chgrp is executed ,group doesn't                              existSorry - Indicated that you have typed in an invalid super user password(execu-        tion of the su)Permission denied!- Indicated you must be the owner or a super user to change                    password.Sorry <[# of weeks] since last change - This will happen when password has                                            has not aged enough and you tried to                                        change it(passwd)[directory name]:no permission - You are trying to remove a directory which                                 you have no permission to.[file name] not removed - trying to delete a file owned by another user                          that you dont have write pemision for. [dirname] not removed - ownership of the dir is not your that your trying to                          delete. [dirname] not empty - the directory contains files so you must have to delete                      the files before executing the rmdir [command] not found - you have entered an ivalid command not know to UNIXcant execute pwd - some thing wrong with the system cant execute pwd commandcannot chdir to .. -   (.. one level up) permision is required to execute pwd                       above the current directorycant open [file name] - defined wrong path,file name or you have no read                        permissioncp:[file name] and [file name] are identical - self explanatory  cannot locate parent directory - occurs when using mv[file name] not found - file which your trying to move doesn't exsistYou have mail - Self explanatoryBasic Networking Utility error messages---------------------------------------cu:not found - networking not installedlogin failed - invalid id/pw or wrong # specifieddial failed - the systen never answered due to a wrong #uucp completely failed - did not specify file after -swrong time to call - you called at the time at a time not specified in the                     Systems filesystem not in systems - you called a remote not in the systems fileLogon format : first thing one must do is switch to lower case--------------Identifing a UNIX.Here is what you'll see:Some times there will be no system identifer                             AT&T UNIX SysVR3.0 (eg of a system identifier)login: orLogin:Any of these is a UNIX.Here is where you will have to guess at a user validid.Here are some that I have come across eg( glr,glt,radgo,rml,chester,cat,lom,cora,hlto,hwill,edcasey and also some containing numbers smith1,mitu6 orspecial characters in it like bremer$,j#fox.Login names have to be 3 to 8chracters in lenght lowercase and must start with a letter.In some XENIXsystems one may login as "guest"User level accounts:(lower case)-------------------- In Unix they have whats called accounts .Theseaccounts can be used at the "login:" prompt.Here is a list:sysbintroubledaemonuucpnuucp  rjelpadmlisten - if starlan is installedSuper-user accounts:--------------------And then there are super-user login which make UNIX worth hacking.   The accounts are used for a specific job. In large systems these loginsare assingned to users who have a responsibilty to maintain subsystems.They are as follows :(all lower case)root       -  this is a must the system comes configured with it.It has no              restriction.Has power over every other account.unmountsys -  unmounts filessetup      -  system set upmakefsys   -  makes a new filesysadm     -  allows useful S.A commands(doesn't need root login)powerdown  -  powering system downmountfsys  -  mounts filescheckfsys  -  checks fileThese accounts will definitly have passwords assigned to them.Theseaccounts are also commands used by the system administrator.Here are some examples of accounts I have seen:cron         uuhelp     usenetanonuccp     news       networkbellboy      lp         vectorguest        games      ninjavote         warble     sysinfoAfter the login prompt you will receive a password prompt:password:  orPassword:    Enter the password (it wont echo).The password rule is as follows:Each pwhas to contain at least 6 characters and maximum has to be 8 .Two of which areto be alphabetic letters and at least one being a number or a special characterThe alphabetic digits could be in upper case or lower case.Here are some of thepasswords that I have seen (eg.Ansuya1,PLAT00N6,uFo/78,ShAsHi..,Div417co)The passwords for the super user accounts will be difficult to hacktry  the accounts interchangebly eg.login:sysadm password:makefsys or rje1,sysop,sysop1,bin4 or they might contain letter,numbers,special chracters inthem.It could be anything.The user passwords are changed by an aging proccessat successive intervals.The users are forced to changed it.The super-userwill pick a password that wont need changing for a long period of time.You have made it! ----------------- The hard part is over and hopefully you have hacked a super-user account.Remember Control-d stops a process and also logs you off.The next thing you'll probably see is the system newseg.login:john password:hacker1        System news                 There will be no networking offered to the users tillaugust 15,due to hardware problems.             (just an example)$$ is the Unix prompt -waiting for a command to be entered.I will use this                      throught the article to show outouts etc..(Its not                      part of the command)# - means your logged in as root(very good)A word about the XENIX System III:(run on the tandy 6000)---------------------------------                  The largest weakness in the XENIX System III occurs after the installationof the Profile-16 or more commonly know as the filepro-16.I have seen the     filepro-16 installed in many systems.          The installation process creates an entry in the password file for a user  named \fBprofile\fR ,an account that who owns and administors the database.The great thing about it is that when the account is created ,no password isassigned to it.The database contains executable to maintain it.The databasecreation programs perform a \fBsetuid\fR to boot up the \fBoot\fR  there by giving a person the whole C Shell to gain Super User privilege same as root.Intresting huh!                     * Note: First the article will inform you of how the Unix is made upThe Unix is made if three components-The shell,the kernal,file system. The kernal:-----------You could say that the kernal is the heart of the Unix operating system.The kernal is a low level language lower than the shell which maintainsprocesses .The kernal handles memory usage ,maintains file systemthe sofware and hardware devices. The shell:----------The shell a higher level language. The shell had two important uses,to act as command interpreture for example using commands like cat,who,       ls the the shell is at work figuring out whether you have entered a commandcorrectly or not.The second most important reason for the shell is its abilityto be used as programing language.Suppose your performing some tasks      repeatedly over and over again,You can program the shell to do this for you.         The file system:   ---------------The file system in Unix is divede into 3 catagories:Directories,ordinary filesand special files.(d,-)          Basic stucture:        (/)-this is abreviation for the root dirctory.  root level                      root                                  (/)                                  system-------------------------------------|----------------------------------level|      |        |         |                  |        |       |        |/unix   /etc    /dev      /tmp               /lib     /usr    /usr2    /bin        |                                        _____|_____login passwd                                     |    |    |level                                            /john  /cathy                                 ________________________|_______________                            |        |     |      |        |        |                        .profile   /mail  /pers  /games   /bin     /michelle*.profile -

contains system administrators files,Most are not available to the       regular user.(this directory contains the /passwd file)    Here are some files under /etc directory:    /etc/passwd    /etc/utmp    /etc/adm/sulog    /etc/motd    /etc/group    /etc/conf    /etc/profile  /dev -

assuming that you have hacked into a super user acc checkfsys$This gives you the full login directory.The / before tell you the locationof the root directory                     or(REFER TO THE DIAGRAM ABOVE)$ pwd$ /usr/john   $Assuming you have hacked into johns acc.Now lets say you wanted to move down to the michelle directory( you own this)that contains letters.You would type in$ cd michelle or cd usr/john/michelle$ pwd$ /usr/john/michelle$Going back one directory up type in:$ cd ..or going to your parent directory just type in "cd"      Listing file directories assuming you are in the parent directory:$ ls /usr/johnmailpersgames        binmichelleThis wont give you the .profile file .To view it type$ cd$ ls -a::.profileTo list file names in michelles directory type in:$ ls michelle (that if your in the johns directory)$ ls /usr/john/michelle(parent dir)ls -l            -----             The ls -l is an an important command in unix.This command displays the wholedirectory in long format :Run this in parent directory$ ls -ltotal 60-rwxr-x---    5 john      bluebox    10 april 9  7:04  maildrwx------    7 john      bluebox    30 april 2  4:09  pers     :            :         :         :     :      :    :     :            :         :         :     :      :    :-rwxr-x---     6 cathy    bluebox    13 april 1  13:00 partys     :            :         :         :     :      :    :$   The total 60 tells one the ammount of disk space used in a directory.The     -rwxr-x--- is read in triples of 3.The first chracter eg(-,d,b,c)-means asfollows: - is an ordinary file ,d is a directory,b is block file,c is achracter file.The r stands for read permission,w is write permission,x is execute.The firstcolum is read in 3 triples as stated above.The first group of 3 (in -rwxr-x---)after the "-" specifies the permission for the owner of the file,the secondtriple are for the groups (the fourth colum) and the last triple are the      permissions for all other users.Therefore the -rwxr-x--- is read as follows.The owner john has permission to read,write and execute anything in the bindirectory but the group has no write permission to it and the rest of the usershave no permission at all.The format of one of the lines in the above outputis as follows:file type-permissions,links,usersname,group,bytes taken,date,time when lastrenued,directory or file name.**You will be able to read,execute cathys file named party due to the samegroup***chmod                    -----             The chmod command changes permission of a directory or a file.Format ischmod who+,-,=r,w,xThe who is substituted by u-user,g-group,o-other users,a-all.The + means add permission,- means remove permission,= - assign.  Example :If you wanted all other users to read the file name mail ,type:   $ chmod o+r mail cat         ---          Now suppose you wanted to read the file letter .There are teo ways to doingthis.First go to the michelle directory then type in:$ cat letterline one ...\line two ... }the output of letterline three../$   orIf you are in the parent directory type in:$ cat /usr/john/michelle/letterand you will have the same output.Some cat options are  -s,-u,-v,-e,-tSpecial Chracters in Unix:-------------------------*  - matches any number of single characters eg. ls john* will list     all files that begin with john[...] - matchs any one of the chracter in the [ ]? - matches any single chracterruns a process in the backgroung leaving your terminal free$ - Values used for variables also $n - null argument> - redirectes output< - redirects input to come from a file>> - redirects command to be added to the end of a file| - pipe output (eg:who|wc-l tells us how many users are online)"..." - Turn of meaning of special chracters excluding $,``...` - allows command output in to be used in a command line'...' - turns of special meaning of all chracterscontinuation of local commands...[     ] -contains the options used------------------------------- passwd------Password changing seems to be a big thing among the savants.Anyway to changethe password one would use the 'passwd' command as shown below:   $passwd   Changing password for john   Old password:                                 New password:                                 Retype new password:   $  This will only work when the password has aged enoughps--Its sometimes necessary to see what command procesess you are running,thiscommand lets you see that.ps [-a all processes except group leaders] [-e all processes] [-f the whole   list]                                                              $ps   PID   TTY  TIME   COMMAND   200   tty09 14:20  ps   The systems reports (PID - process idenetification number which is a #   from 1-30,000 assigned to UNIX processes)   It also reports the TTY,TIME and the COMMAND being executed at the time.   To stop a process enter :       $kill [PID] (this case its 200)   200 terminated   $grep----This comand is important when seaching for a word or words in large files.grep [argument] [file name] - searchs for an file that contains the argument                              for example:   $ grep phone cathy    phone   michelle  (718)5551234    phone   cindy   (718)5553456    What this did was to find the argument 'phone' in the file cathy.If the    argument consists of two or more words then  it must be enclosed in single    quotes.mv--mv [file names(s)] [ dir name ] - renames a file or moves it to another                                       directory eg.         $mv letter letters    $   This renames the file letter to letters thereby deleting letter                  or if you want to move files then   $mv /usr/john/pers/capital /usr/john/michelle/capital   $      This moves the file capital to the directory named michellediff----diff [file name] [ file name] - show diffrence between two files.Output of this                                will have something like 4,5c4,5 then the it                                will display both sets of files on the screen                                The 4,5c4,5 means that you must change "c"                                lines 4 to 5 in one file to line 4 to 5 in                                   another.      Option for using this command are :       -b  -  it ignores blank spaces       -h  - compares it quickly       -s  - reports files that are the same       -S[file] - this is when you want to compare a directory starting at a                  specific file              There is also a command to compare 3 files which is :           diff3 [options] [file1] [file2] [file3]cp--cp [file name] [file name] - makes a copy of a file   $ cp letter letters   $   The file letters is a dupilcate copy of letter.In this case the original   is not erased like in the mv command.... more UNIX commands:--------------------man [command] or [c/r] -will give you a list of commands explainationshelp - available on some UNIX systems                  mkdir [dir name(s)] - makes a directory      rmdir [dir name(s)] - removes directory.You wont be able to remove the                      directory if it contains files in themrm [file name(s)] - removes files. rm * will erase all files in the current                    dir.Be carefull you!!.Some options are :                                    [-f unconditional removal] [-i Prompts user for y or n]                        write [login name ] - to write to other logged in users.Sort of a chatmesg [-n] [-y] - doesn't allow others to send you messages using the write                 command.Wall used by system adm overrides it.$ [file name] -

Sends message to the login name.Chat!su [login name]---------------The su command allows one to switch user to a super user to a user.Veryimportant could be used to switch to super user accounts.Usage:                                                $ su sysadmpassword:This su command will be monitored in /usr/adm/sulog and this file of all filesis carefully monitered by the system administrator.Suppose you hacked in johnsaccount and then switched to the sysadm account (ABOVE) your /usr/adm/sulogentry would look like:SU  04/19/88  21:00 + tty 12 john-sysadmTherfore the S.A(system administrator) would know that john swithed to sysadmaccount on 4/19/88 at 21:00 hoursSearching for valid login names:   -------------------------------Type in-$ who  ( command informs the user of other users on the system)cathy  tty1  april 19  2:30john   tty2  april 19  2:19dipal  tty3  april 19  2:31::tty is the users terminal,date,time each logged on.dipal,john are validlogins.   Files worth concatenating(cat)/etc/passwd file:                    -----------------                     The etc/passwd is a vital file to cat.For it contains login names of allusers including super user accounts and there passwords.In the newer          SVR3 releases they are tighting their security by moving the encryptedpasswords from /etc/passwd to /etc/shadow making it only readable by root.This is optional offcourse.$ cat /etc/passwdroot:D943/sys34:0:1:0000:/:sysadm:k54doPerate:0:0:administration:usr/admin:/bin/rshcheckfsys:Locked;:0:0:check file system:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh:other super user accs.:john:chips11:34:3:john scezerend:/usr/john::other users:$If you have reached this far capture this file as soon as posible.This is a typical output etc/passwd file.The entries are seperatedby a ":".There made be up to 7 fields in each line.Eg.sysadm account.The first is the login name in this case sysadm.The second field contains thepassword.The third field contains the user id."0 is the root".Then comes thegroup id then the account which contains the user full name etc .The sixthfield is the login directory defines the full path name of the the particlar account and the last is the program to be executed.          Now one can switch to other super user account using su command descibed above.The password entry in the field of the checkfsys account in the above exampleis "Locked;". This doesn't mean thats its a password but the accountcheckfsys cannot be accessed remotely.The ";" acts as an unused encryptionchracter.A space is also used for the same purpose.You will find this in manyUNIX systems that are small systems where the system administrator handlesall maintaince.  Password aging:  ---------------If password aging is active the user is forced to change the password at    regular intervals.One may be able to tell just by looking at the /etc/passwdfile when the password is allowed to be changed and when it is compulsory tochange it.For example the entry:john:chips11,43:34:3:John Scezerend:/usr/john:The password contains an extension of (,43) which mean that john can change hasto change the password atleast evert 6 weeks and can keep it for atleast 3week.The format used is [password],Mmww.The M is the maxiumum number of weekspassword has to be change and m is the minimum interval password can be changedand the ww is indicates when the password was last changed.    Aging chart:---------|-----------Character|# of weeks    .    |  0    /    |  1 0-9     | 2-11 A-Z     | 12-37 a-z     | 38-63---------|-----------From the above anyone can determine the number of weeks one can chnage the    password.         The (ww) is automatically added as to when the password was last changed .   IF SHAWDOWING IS ACTIVE:------------------------If the shawdowing is active the /etc/passwd would look like this:root:x:0:1:0000:/:sysadm:x:0:0:administration:/usr/admin:/bin/rshThe password filed is substituted by "x".The /etc/shawdow file only readable by root will look similar tothis:root:D943/sys34:5288:::super user accounts:Cathy:masai1:5055:7:120:all other users:  The first field contains users id:the second contains the password(The pw willbe NONE if logining in remotely is deactivated):the third contains a code ofwhen the password was last changed:the fourth and the fifth contains the minimum and the maximum numbers of days for pw changes(Its rare that you willfind this in the super user logins due to there hard to guess passwords)  /etc/options directory-----------------------The etc/options dir will consists of utilities available in the system.Example:                  -rwxr-xr-x   1 root  sys   40 april  1:00  uucp.name                uucp standing for BNU/etc/group-----------The file has each group on the system.Each line will have 4 entries separatedby a ":" . Example of concatenated /etc/group:root::0:rootadm::2:adm,rootbluebox::70:Group name:password:group id:login names** It very unlikely that groups will have passwords assigned to them **The id "0" is assigned to /Sending and recieving messages:-------------------------------Two programs are used to manage this.They are mail & mailx.The differencebetween them is that mailx is more fancier thereby giving you many choiceslike replying message ,using editors etc.Sending:--------  The basic format for using this command is:$mail [login(s)](now one would enter the textafter finishing enter "." a periodon the next blank line)$This command is also used to send mail to remote systems.Suppose you wantedto send mail to john on a remote called ATT01you would type in:$mail ATT01!johnMail can be sent to several users,just by entering more login name afterissuing the mail command Using mailx is the same format:(This I'll describe very briefly)$mailx johnsubject:(this lets you enter the subject)(line #1)(line #2)(After you finish enter (~.) not the brackets offcourse ,more commands areavailable like ~p,~r,~v,~m,~h,~b etc.)Receiving:----------After you log on to the system you will the account may have mail waiting.You will be notified "you have mail".   To read this enter:       $mail(line #1)(line #2)(line #3)?       $After the message you will be prompted with a question mark.Here you have achoice to delete it by entering d,saving it to view it later s,or just pressenter to view the next message.(DONT BE A SAVANT AND DELETE THE POOR GUYS MAIL)Super user commands:--------------------$sysadm adduser - will take you through a routine to add a user                 (may not last long)Enter this:$ sysadm adduserpassword:(this is what you will see)/--------------------------------------------------------------------------\  Process running succommmand `adduser`       USER MANAGMENT  Anytime you want to quit, type "q".  If you are not sure how to answer any prompt, type "?" for help  If a default appears in the question,press <RETURN> for the default.  Enter users full name [?,q]: (enter the name you want)                  Enter users login ID [?,q]:(the id you want to use)  Enter users ID number (default 50000) [?,q) [?,q]:( press return )  Enter group ID number or group name:(any name from /etc/group)  Enter users login home directory:(enter /usr/name)      This is the information for the new login:  Users name: (name)  login ID:(id)  users ID:50000  group ID or name:       home directory:/usr/name Do you want to install,edit,skip [i,e,s,q]?
