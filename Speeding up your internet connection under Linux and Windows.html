tutorials on subjects such as hacking, cracking, phreaking, Unix, Windows and 
Windows NT, networking, hardware and overclocking, programming, HTML and more at

<H2>1 Good old dry theory</H2>
<H3>1.1 Introduction</H3>The internet is going thru an evolution, faster pc's, 
more reliable connections etc... But the greatest evolution are the capacity of 
the lines. What where telephone line are now ISDN lines or cable modems. But 
there are still people (unfortunate people like me) who have such a sloppy 
telephone line, which is sloooooow. So people are beginning to search ways to 
speed up their connection. Their are tools like download managers, tools that 
download the underlying pages of a visited web site in idle times. And so there 
are many ways that go to adjusting the hardware of your modem. 
<P>Like you all see the software is either Windows based or lets you fuck up 
your hardware. This way is for Linux and is so easy a Windows user could do it 
:P <BR>There is also an explanation on how to do the exact same thing under 
Windows 
<H3>1.2 Who should be reading this document, requirements</H3>Everyone who wants 
to speed up their (modem) dial-up account by some seconds. And want to do this 
in five minutes (if not less). 
<P>Before asking any questions, please make sure you have read at least the 
basic networking tutorials at blacksun.box.sk. <BR>If you still have questions 
regarding this tutorial, please make sure you've already read at least some of 
the basic networking tutorials at blacksun.box.sk. Also, please do not Email any 
member of BSRF directly. There is a message board at blacksun.box.sk - use it. 
<P>Information on how to do the same thing under Windows can be found at the 
bottom of the tutorial. 
<P>Requirements 
<UL>
  <LI>A computer 
  <LI>A dial-up connection to the internet 
  <LI>Linux up and running 
  <LI>Named installed (1) 
  <LI>5 minutes of time 
  <LI>Some spare change for me (*grin*) </LI></UL><I>(1) Named is a the nameserver 
package, this is standard and the most commone Linux distrubution and should 
bring no problems while installing</I> 
<H3>1.3 What does a nameserver do?</H3>What does a nameserver do ? Well, suppose 
you are dialed in with you ISP and you wish to go to www.xxxxx.com. You open up 
you browser and type in the URL box http://www.xxxxx.com, you press enter and 
wait until xxxxx appears. <BR>Simple, isn't it ? Let's look behind the scenes to 
find out what's really going on in here. 
<OL>
  <LI>Your computer gets the request to connect to www.xxxxx.com, but what is 
  www.xxxxx.com ? Well it the alias of a computer (which has an ip) and has an 
  httpd daemon running (on port 80). 
  <LI>Your computers checks if that site isn't running on your own computer or 
  on you local network. So it checks your /etc/hosts file (which has you local 
  intranet information) or it checks a local nameserver (but because you're 
  reading this I guess you don't have a nameserver installed (yet) so that won't 
  be the case). By the way, this is a good chance to mention that 
  DNS&nbsp;stands for Domain Name server. 
  <LI>In fact your computer doesn't check if www.xxxxx.com is on your local 
  network, it checks if it can find the ip of www.xxxxx.com on you local 
  intranet. (You 'might' have heard once that the entire internet is tcp/ip 
  based :P) 
  <LI>Then your computer checks the file /etc/resolv.conf file should look like 
  this. 
  <P><BR><I>nameserver 123.123.123.123</I> </P>
  <LI>This is the nameserver of you ISP. And when nothing can be found on the 
  local intranet you computer will query this nameserver. (if this nameserver is 
  unreachable the you'll get an error). 
  <LI>When this nameserver is reachable it will answer with an ip. If 
  www.xxxxx.com is unknown to the nameserver it will query some other 
  nameserver. But in the end you'll get your ip. 
  <LI>Once this ip (lets say 123.123.123.111) is known there will be tried to 
  establish a connection to 123.123.123.111:80 (this connection will be made by 
  the standard routing procedure as can be viewed by typing <I>route</I> from a 
  root shell. </LI></OL>Now the communication will be established, files will be 
transferd using the http protocol. So the nameserver simply translates 
www.xxxxx.com into an ip by quering its own databases or querying other 
databases. 
<H3>1.4 Whooow that sounds very cool !!! So ? :p</H3>Well suppose those seven 
steps take about 2 seconds (if you have a speedy connection and your ISP has a 
nameserver with almost no network traffic and if the ip is in the nameservers 
cache). So if this was an utopia it would take two seconds. So in these times 
it'll take a bit longer. In this tutorial we'll make something called 'a caching 
only nameserver'. 
<H3>1.5 What is a caching only nameserver</H3>Well, this is a special 'type' of 
nameserver. This is not intended to be the nameserver of your intranet. The only 
thing it does is to cache all names and ip's that are queried from the local 
network. The first time you query an ip, an other database has to be queried 
(isp). But any other time that query does not have to find place. It is on you 
own hard disk, so it doesn't consume any bandwidth, and site will come up some 
seconds faster on your screen which makes surfing a lot more FUN. You can say 
now what the hell are two seconds? Yes but how often do you go to a search 
engine ? How often do you go to you favorite site and further, how often doe you 
check your e-mail ? (once every 10 minutes is a Netscape default) 
<P>Here ends the theory, now you should be able to understand what a caching 
only nameserver does and how it can speed up you connection with a few seconds, 
now go ahead and type something. 
<H2>2 Fuck that damned theory, let me type something</H2>
<H3>2.1 named.conf</H3>First we edit the general config file of the nameserver. 
The file is called /etc/named.conf and it should look like: <PRE><I>options {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directory "/var/named";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Some shit */
};
....</I></PRE>This first part of the file is the one that needs changes. For 
this you need to know the nameserver of your ISP (NOT the name but the IP !!!), 
you change the file to: <PRE><I>options {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directory "/var/named";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forwarders {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 123.123.123.123;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 123.123.123.124;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };
};
....</I></PRE>You've now simple said that an unknown query has to be forwarded 
to the ip's above. If the first is not reachable the second one will be tried. 
<H3>2.2 Changing the nameserver</H3>In fact you have now an up and (almost) 
running nameserver. There is just one little detail you have to take care of, 
that's the fact that your computer doesn't recognize / will use you nameserver 
yet. You have to edit <I>/etc/resolv.conf </I>. And you should edit the file so 
it'll look like: <PRE><I># nameserver 321.321.321.321
nameserver 127.0.0.1</I></PRE>The first line was your original nameserver, just 
comment this (you never know ...) and then you add the line <I>nameserver 
127.0.0.1 </I>this just says that queries no longer have to be forwarded but can 
be answered by you OWN local nameserver. 
<H3>2.3 Up and running</H3>Now you just have to (re)start your nameserver with 
<I>killall -HUP named </I>. Then you check you logs ( /var/log/messages ) and 
hope they'll look like <PRE>Nov 20 13:29:34 SaTaN named[692]: starting.&nbsp; named 8.2.1 Fri Sep 24 14:52:24 EDT 1999 ^Iroot@porky.devel.redhat.com:/usr/src/bs/BUILD/bind-8.2.1/src/bin/named
Nov 20 13:29:34 SaTaN named[692]: hint zone "" (IN) loaded (serial 0)
Nov 20 13:29:34 SaTaN named[692]: Zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" (file named.local): No default TTL set using SOA minimum instead
Nov 20 13:29:34 SaTaN named[692]: master zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" (IN) loaded (serial 1997022700)
Nov 20 13:29:34 SaTaN named[692]: listening on [127.0.0.1].53 (lo)

Nov 20 13:29:34 SaTaN named[693]: Ready to answer queries.
Nov 20 13:29:34 SaTaN named[693]: sysquery: sendto([123.123.123.123].53): Network is unreachable</PRE>If 
you see a last line, like mine, don't worry about it. It means you are not yet 
connected to the internet. When you get some erros, it means that you have not 
edited you config file properly so you have check it again. (hint: check if all 
the ; are in place and every { is closed with an } ) 
<H3>2.4 U don't believe me ?</H3>Ok, for everyone who doesn't believe me ... <PRE><I>[root@SaTaN /] nslookup www.iwanttoquerythis.com
Server: localhost
Address: 127.0.0.1

Name: www.iwanttoquerythis.com
Address: 123.123.123.321 ... other ip's ..
Aliases: If available ...</I></PRE>This was the first query and a request was 
sent to the nameserver mentioned in the config file. For this far you know you 
nameserver can forward addresses :p it's a start. <PRE><I>[root@SaTaN /] nslookup www.iwanttoquerythis.com
Server: localhost
Address: 127.0.0.1

NON-AUTHORITIVE ANSWER
Name: www.iwanttoquerythis.com
Address: 123.123.123.321
Aliases: ...</I></PRE>Cool, it says Non-authoritive answer. What does it means ? 
Well, it just wants to say that for that answer there was no need to forward the 
request, cool huh ? <BR>&nbsp; 
<H3>2.5 And here's another way to do it</H3>You can also manage your local DNS 
database by yourself! Simply add lines to the /etc/hosts file that will look 
like this: <BR>IP-address hostname #comment <BR>For example: <BR>1.2.3.4 
www.some-website.com #just another stupid website <BR>In case you're wondering, 
you don't HAVE to put a comment...&nbsp; :p <BR>Oh, by the way, this method is 
inferior because you have to enter IPs and hostnames by yourself... ouch... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<H3>2.6 Local DNS cache under Windows</H3>Hello, poor Windows users. Want to 
make yourself a nice local DNS cache? Too bad, 'cause you can only use the 
method described in chapter 2.5, only you will be using c:\windows\hosts (not to 
be confused with c:\windows\hosts.sam, which is a sample file for 
c:\windows\hosts) instead of /etc/hosts. If you don't wanna do this manually, 
you could try and find a program called FastNet, which will scan your browser's 
bookmarks and history database and automatically add every URL you visit to this 
database, and will also let you add entries manually. 
<H2>3 The end</H2>
<H3>3.1 Outro</H3>You should be able to put up you own caching only nameserver.
