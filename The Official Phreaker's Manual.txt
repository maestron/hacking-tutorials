Many times I have been on a BBS, whichhas files claiming to have summed up all the ways to phreak in the U.S. andabroad, well those were pretty lame and a couple pages long.  Now after manyrelentless hours of work, I have done it.  This is an informative file and theauthors of this and the authors from which I have gathered information, takeabsolutely NO responsibility and are not liable for, under any circumstancesfor damage, direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential.    Warning: Use of this material may shorten your life in the free world!   Ok enough of the bullshit, I readily admit that this is mainly a compilationof available phreak material and public resources.  What I have done is togather it all together and edit, compile, check for errors, put in a readableform, and finally to write what I know without echoing what others have said.I have set this up that it is good for all levels of phreaks, going from noviceto advanced, and references and tables for easy reference in the back.   This manual is constantly being updated!  If you have any contributions orcorrections or comments, please leave messages to me (Jack the Ripper) on anyBBS's I am on (probably where you got it).  Thanks!                                    Page 2                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    **********************************************************************                               Table of Contents    **********************************************************************I....... 005 Chapter 1I.1..... 006 Glossary of Phreaking termsI.2..... 010 Glossary of Phreaking terms cont.I.3..... 017 Boxes and Electronic Toll FraudI.4..... 020 How to be a Real PhreakI.5..... 026 Basic Telecommunications I, A Phreaks guideII...... 031 Chapter 2II.1.... 033 Secrets of the Little Blue Box.

After the vocab, will be some of thegeneral rules for phreaking.  Most of the rules are protection from the policeand AT&T, but others are grammatical rules.  These are not as important to yourfreedom, but many a phreak will think you are a twelve year old if you starttalking like, "Hey dudz!^$(&, just got the latest warez! trade u for somesoft/docs. Checkul8r".

Thefunctional equivalent to an intraoffice trunk.MF: Multifrequency - The method of signaling over a trunk making use of thesimultaneous application of two out of six possible frequencies.NPA: Numbering Plan Area.ONI: Operator Number Identification - The use of an operator in a CAMA officeto verbally obtain the calling number of a call originating in an office notequipped with ANI.PBX: Private Branch Exchange - (PABX: Private Automatic Branch Exchange) Antelephone office serving a private customer, Typically , access to the outsidetelephone network is provided.Permanent Signal: A sustained off-hook condition without activity (no dialingor ringing or completed connection); such a condition tends to tie upequipment, especially in earlier systems. Usually accidental, but sometimesused intentionally by customers in high-crime-rate areas to thwart offburglars.POTS: Plain Old Telephone Service - Basic service with no extra "frills".ROTL: Remote Office Test Line - A means for remotely testing trunks.RTA: Remote Trunk Arrangement - An extension to the TSPS system permitting itsservices to be provided up to 200 miles from the TSPS site.SF: Single Frequency.

Synonym:   Speed DialingACCESS CHARGE: A fee paid for the use of local lines.ACCESS CODE: A digit or number of digits required to be connected to a privateline arranged for dial access.ACCESS LINE: A telephone circuit which connects a customer location to anetwork switching center.AIRLINE MILEAGE: Calculated point-to-point mileage between terminalfacilities.ALL TRUNKS BUSY (ATB): A single tone interrupted at a 120 ipm (impulses perminute) rate to indicate all lines or trunks in a routing group are busy.ALTERNATE ROUTE: A secondary communications path used to reach a destination ifthe primary path is unavailable.ALTERNATE USE: The ability to switch communications facilities from one type ofservice to another, i.e., voice to data, etc.ALTERNATE VOICE DATA (AVD): A single transmission facility which can be usedfor either voice or data.AMERICAN STANDARD CODEFOR INFORMATION INTERCHANGE(ASCII): An 8 level code developed for the interchange of information betweendata processing and communications systems.ANALOG SIGNAL: A signal in the form of a continuous varying physical quantity,e.g., voltage which reflects variations in some quantity, e.g., loudness in thehuman voice.                                    Page 10                        The Official Phreaker's ManualANNUNICATOR: An audible intercept device that states the condition orrestrictions associated with circuits or procedures.ANSWER BACK: An electrical and/or visual indication to the calling or sendingend that the called or received station is on the line.ANSWER SUPERVISION: An off-hook signal transmitted toward the calling end of aswitched connection when the called party answers.AREA CODE: Synonym: Numbering Plan Area (NPA). A three digit number identifyingmore than 150 geographic areas of the United States and Canada which permitsdirect distance dialing on the telephone system. A similar global numberingplan has been established for international subscriber dialing.ATTENDANT POSITION: A telephone switchboard operator's position. It provideseither automatic (cordless) or manual (plug and jack) operator controls forincoming and/or outgoing telephone calls.ATTENUATION: A general term used to denote the decrease in power between thattransmitted and that received due to loss through equipment, lines, or othertransmission devices. It is usually expressed as a ration in db (decibel).(B) ENTRANCE INTO THE DDD TOLL NETWORK MAY BE EFFECTED BY A PRETEXT CALL TO ANYOTHER TOLL-FREE # SUCH AS UNIVERSAL DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE (555-1212) OR ANY # INTHE INWATS NETWORK, EITHER INTER-STATE OR INTRA-STATE, WORKING OR NON-WORKING.(C) ENTRANCE INTO THE DDD TOLL NETWORK MAY ALSO BE IN THE FORM OF "SHORT HAUL"CALLING. A "SHORT HAUL" CALL IS A CALL TO ANY # WHICH WILL RESULT IN A LESSERAMOUNT OF TOLL CHARGES THAN THE CHARGES FOR THE CALL TO BE COMPLETED BY THEBLUE BOX. FOR EXAMPLE, A CALL TO  BIRMINGHAM FROM ATLANTA MAY COST $.80 FOR THEFIRST 3 MINUTES WHILE A CALL FROM ATLANTA TO LOS ANGELES IS $1.85 FOR 3MINUTES. THUS, A SHORT HAUL, 3-MINUTE CALL TO BIRMINGHAM FROM ATLANTA, SWITCHEDBY USE OF A BLUE BOX TO LOS ANGELES, WOULD RESULT IN A NET FRAUD OF $2.65 FOR A3 MINUTE CALL.(D) A BLUE BOX MAY BE WIRED INTO THE TELEPHONE LINE OR ACOUSTICALLY CONNECTEDTO THE HANDSET. THE BLUE BOX MAY EVEN BE BUILT INSIDE A REGULAR TOUCH-TONEPHONE, USING THE PHONE'S PUSH BUTTONS FOR THE BLUE BOX'S SIGNALLING TONES.(E) A MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDING MAY BE USED TO RECORD THE BLUE BOX TONESREPRESENTATIVE OF SPECIFIC PHONE #'S. SUCH A TAPE RECORDING COULD BE USED INLIEU OFA BLUE BOX TO FRAUDULENTLY PLACE CALLS TO THE PHONE #'S RECORDED ON THEMAGNETIC TAPE.     ALL BLUE BOXES, EXCEPT "DIAL PULSE" OR "ROTARY SF" BLUE BOXES, MUST HAVETHE FOLLOWING 4 COMMON OPERATING CAPABILITIES:(A) IT MUST HAVE SIGNALLING CAPABILITY IN THE FORM OF A 2600HZ TONE. THE TONEIS USED BY THE TOLL NETWORK TO INDICATE, EITHER BY ITS PRESENCE OR ITS ABSENCE,AN "ON HOOK" (IDLE) OR "OFF HOOK" (BUSY) CONDITION OF THE TRUNK.(B) THE BLUE BOX MUST HAVE A "KP" TONES THAT UNLOCKS OR READIES THEMULTI-FREQUENCY RECEIVER AT THE CALLED END TO RECEIVE THE TONES CORRESPONDINGTO THE CALLED PHONE #.                                    Page 18                        The Official Phreaker's Manual(C) THE TYPICAL BLUE BOX MUST BE ABLE TO EMIT MF TONES WHICH ARE USED TOTRANSMIT PHONE #'S OVER THE TOLL NETWORK. EACH DIGIT OF A PHONE # ISREPRESENTED BY A COMBINATION OF 2 TONES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DIGIT 2 IS X-MITTEDBY A COMBINATION OF 700HZ AND 1100HZ.(D) THE BLUE BOX MUST HAVE AN "ST" KEY WHICH CONSISTS OF A COMBINATION OF 2TONES THAT TELL THE EQUIPMENT AT THE CALLED END THAT ALL DIGITS HAVE BEEN SENTAND THAT THE EQUIPMENT SHOULD START SWITCHING THE CALL TO THE CALLED NUMBER.   THE "DIAL PULSER" OR "ROTARY SF" BLUE BOX REQUIRES ONLY A DIAL WITH ASIGNALLING CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE A 2600HZ TONE.*BLACK BOX*-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-     THIS ETF DEVICE IS SO-NAMED BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THE FIRST ONE FOUND.IT VARIES IN SIZE AND USUALLY HAS ONE OR TWO SWITCHES OR BUTTONS.  ATTACHED TOTHE TELEPHONE LINE OF A CALLED PARTY, THE BLACK BOX PROVIDES TOLL-FREE CALLING*TO* THAT PARTY'S LINE. A BLACK BOX USER INFORMS OTHER PERSONS BEFOREHAND THATTHEY WILL NOT BE CHARGED FOR ANY CALL PLACED TO HIM. THE USER THEN OPERATES THEDEVICE CAUSING A "NON-CHARGE" CONDITION  ("NO ANSWER" OR "DISCONNECT") TO BERECORDED ON THE TELEPHONE COMPANY'S BILLING EQUIPMENT. A BLACK BOX ISRELATIVELY SIMPLE TO CONSTRUCT AND IS MUCH LESS SOPHISTICATED THAN A BLUE BOX.*CHEESE BOX*-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  ITS DESIGN MAY BE CRUDE OR VERY SOPHISTICATED. ITS SIZE VARIES; ONE WAS FOUNDTHE SIZE OF A HALF-DOLLAR.  A CHEESE BOX IS USED MOST OFTEN BY BOOKMAKERS ORBETTERS TO PLACE WAGERS WITHOUT DETECTION FROM A REMOTE LOCATION. THE DEVICEINTER-CONNECTS 2 PHONE LINES, EACH HAVING DIFFERENT #'S BUT EACH TERMINATING ATTHE SAME LOCATION. IN EFFECT, THERE ARE 2 PHONES AT THE SAME LOCATION WHICH ARELINKED TOGETHER THROUGH A CHEESE BOX. IT IS USUALLY FOUND IN AN UNOCCUPIEDAPARTMENT CONNECTED TO A PHONE JACK OR CONNECTING BLOCK. THE BOOKMAKER, AT SOMEREMOTE LOCATION, DIALS ONE OF THE NUMBERS AND STAYS ON THE LINE. VARIOUSBETTORS DIAL THE OTHER NUMBER BUT ARE AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTED WITH THEBOOKMAKER BY MEANS OF THE CHEESE BOX INTER-CONNECTION. IF, IN ADDITION TO ACHEESE BOX, A BLACK BOX IS INCLUDED IN THE ARRANGEMENT, THE COMBINED EQUIPMENTWOULD PERMIT TOLL-FREE CALLING ON EITHER LINE TO THE OTHER LINE. IF A POLICERAID WERE CONDUCTED AT THE TERMINATING POINT OF THE CONVERSATIONS -THE LOCATIONOF THE CHEESE BOX- THERE WOULD BE NO EVIDENCE OF GAMBLING ACTIVITY. THIS DEVICEIS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN ADVISEDTHAT WHEN UNUSUAL DEVICES ARE FOUND ASSOCIATED WITH TELEPHONE CONNECTIONS THEPHONE COMPANY SECURITY REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD BE CONTACTED TO ASSIST INIDENTIFICATION. (THIS PROBABLY WOULD BE GOOD FOR A BBS , ESPECIALLY WITH THEBLACK BOX SET UP. AND IF YOU EVER DECIDED TO TAKE THE BOARD DOWN, YOU WOULDN'THAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PHONE #.

Conceivedfrom the boredom and loneliness that could only be derived from: The Traveler!But now, he has returned in full strength (after a small vacation) and is hereto 'World Premiere' the new files everywhere. Stay cool. This is the prequil to the first one, so just relax. This is notmade to be an exclusive ultra elite file, so kinda calm down and watch in thebackground if you are too cool for it.../-/   Phreak Dictionary   /-/ Here you will find some of the basic but necessary terms that should be knownby any phreak who wants to be respected at all... Phreak [fr'eek]:1.  The action of using mischevious and mostly illegal waysin order to not pay for some sort of telecommunications  bill, order, transfer,or other service. It often involves usage of highly illegal boxes and machinesin order to defeat the security that is set up to avoid this sort ofhappening. [fr'eaking]. v. 2.  A person who uses the above methods of destruction andchaos in order to make a better life for all. A true phreaker will not not goagainst his fellows or narc on people who have ragged on him or do anythingtermed to be dishonorable to phreaks. [fr'eek]. n.    3.  A certain code or dialup useful in the action of being aphreak. (Example: "I hacked a new metro phreak last night.") Switching System [Swich'ing sis'tem]: 1.  There are 3 main switching systems currently employedin the US, and a few other systems will be mentioned as background.A) SxS:  This system was invented in 1918 and was employed in over half of thecountry until 1978. It is a very basic system that is a general waste of energyand hard work on the linesman. A good way to identify this is that it requiresa coin in the phone booth before it will give you a dial tone, or that no callwaiting, call forwarding, or any other such service is available. Stands for:Step by StepB) XB:   This switching system was first employed in 1978 in order to take careof most of the faults of SxS switching. Not only is it more efficient, but it                                    Page 20                        The Official Phreaker's Manualalso can support different services in various forms. XB1 is Crossbar Version1. That is very limited and is hard to distinguish from SxS except by directview of the wiring involved. Next up was XB4, Crossbar Version 4. With thissystem, some of the basic things like DTMF that were not available with SxS canbe accomplished. For the final stroke of XB, XB5 was created. This is a servicethat can allow DTMF plus most 800 type services (which were not alwaysavailable...) Stands for: Crossbar.C) ESS:  A nightmare in telecom. In vivid color, ESS is a pretty bad thing tohave to stand up to. It is quite simple to identify. Dialing 911 foremergencies, and ANI [see ANI below] are the most common facets of the dreadsystem. ESS has the capability to list in a person's caller log what number wascalled, how long the call took, and even the status of the conversation (modemor otherwise.) Since ESS has been employed, which has been very recently, ithas gone through many kinds of revisions. The latest system to date is ESS 11a,that is employed in Washington D.C. for security reasons. ESS is truly troublefor any phreak, because it is 'smarter' than the other systems. For instance,if on your caller log they saw 50 calls to 1-800-421-9438, they would be ableto do a CN/A [see Loopholes below] on your number and determine whether you aresubscribed to that service or not. This makes most calls a hazard, becausealthough 800 numbers appear to be free, they are recorded on your caller logand then right before you receive your bill it deletes the billings for them.But before that they are open to inspection, which is one reason why extendeduse of any code is dangerous under ESS. Some of the boxes [see Boxing below]are unable to function in ESS. It is generally a menace to the true phreak.Stands For: Electronic Switching System. because they could appear on a filtersomewhere or maybe it is just nice to know them any ways.             A) SSS: Strowger Switching System. First non-operator systemavailable.             B) WES: Western Electronics Switching. Used about 40 years agowith some minor places out west.  Boxing [Boks'-ing]: 1)  The use of personally designed boxes that emit orcancel electronical impulses that allow simpler acting while phreaking. Throughthe use of separate boxes, you can accomplish most feats possible with orwithout the control of an operator.                      2)  Some boxes and their functions are listed below. Onesmarked with '*' indicate that they are not operatable in ESS.    *Black Box: Makes it seem to the phone company that the phone was neverpicked up.      Blue Box:  Emits a 2600hz tone that allows you to do such things as stacka trunk line, kick the operator off line, and others.       Red Box:  Simulates the noise of a quarter, nickel, or dime beingdropped into a payphone.    Cheese Box:  Turns your home phone into a pay phone to throw off traces (ared box is usually needed in order to call out.)    *Clear Box:  Gives you a dial tone on some of the old SxS payphones withoutputting in a coin.into phone lines and extract by eavesdropping, or crossing wires, etc.    Purple Box:  Makes all calls made out from your house seem to be localcalls. ANI [ANI]: 1)  Automatic Number Identification. A service available on ESSthat allows a phone service [see Dialups below] to record the number that anycertain code was dialed from along with the number that was called and print                                    Page 21                        The Official Phreaker's Manualboth of these on the customer bill. 950 dialups [see Dialups below] are alldesigned just to use ANI. Some of the services do not have the proper equipmentto read the ANI impulses yet, but it is impossible to see which is whichwithout being busted or not busted first. Dialups [dy'l'ups]: 1)  Any local or 800 extended outlet that allows instant access toany service such as MCI, Sprint, or AT&T that from there can be used byhandpicking or using a program to reveal other peoples codes which can then beused moderately until they find out about it and you must switch to anothercode (preferably before they find out about it.)             2)  Dialups are extremely common on both senses. Some dialupsreveal the company that operates them as soon as you hear the tone. Others aremuch harder and some you may never be able to identify. A small list ofdialups:                   1-800-421-9438 (5 digit codes)                   1-800-547-6754 (6 digit codes)                   1-800-345-0008 (6 digit codes)                   1-800-734-3478 (6 digit codes)                   1-800-222-2255 (5 digit codes)             3)  Codes: Codes are very easily accessed procedures when you calla dialup. They will give you some sort of tone. If the tone does not end in 3seconds, then punch in the code and immediately following the code, the numberyou are dialing but strike the '1' in the beginning out first. If the tone doesend, then punch in the code when the tone ends. Then, it will give you anothertone. Punch in the number you are dialing, or a '9'. If you punch in a '9' andthe tone stops, then you messed up a little. If you punch in a tone and thetone continues, then simply dial then number you are calling without the '1'.             4)  All codes are not universal. The only type that I know of thatis truly universal is Metrophone. Almost every major city has a local Metrodialup (for Philadelphia, (215)351-0100/0126) and since the codes areuniversal, almost every phreak has used them once or twice. They do not employANI in any outlets that I know of, so feel free to check through your books andcall 555-1212 or, as a more devious manor, subscribe yourself. Then, never useyour own code. That way, if they check up on you due to your caller log, theycan usually find out that you are subscribed. Not only that but you could set aphreak hacker around that area and just let it hack away, since they usuallygroup them, and, as a bonus, you will have their local dialup.             5)  950's. They seem like a perfectly cool phreakers dream. Theyare free from your house, from payphones, from everywhere, and they host all ofthe major long distance companies (950-1044 <MCI>, 950-1077 <Sprint>, 950-1088<Skylines>, 950-1033 <Us Telecom>.) Well, they aren't. They were designed forANI. That is the point, end of discussion. A phreak dictionary. If you remember all of the things contained on that fileup there, you may have a better chance of doing whatever it is you do. Thisnext section is maybe a little more interesting...Blue Box Plans:---------------   These are some blue box plans, but first, be warned, there have been 2600hztone detectors out on operator trunk lines since XB4. The idea behind it is touse a 2600hz tone for a few very naughty functions that can really make yourday lighten up. But first, here are the plans, or the heart of the file:==============================================700  :   1   :   2   :   4   :   7   :  11   :900  :   +   :   3   :   5   :   8   :  12   :                                    Page 22                        The Official Phreaker's Manual1100 :   +   :   +   :   6   :   9   :  KP   :1300 :   +   :   +   :   +   :  10   :  KP2  :1500 :   +   :   +   :   +   :   +   :  ST   :     : 700   : 900   :1100   :1300   :1500   :============================================== Stop! Before you diehard users start piecing those little tone tidbitstogether, there is a simpler method. If you have an Apple-Cat with a programlike Cat's Meow IV, then you can generate the necessary tones, the 2600hz tone,the KP tone, the KP2 tone, and the ST tone through the dial section. So if youhave that I will assume you can boot it up and it works, and I'll do you thefavor of telling you and the other users what to do with the blue box now thatyou have somehow constructed it. The connection to an operator is one of the most well known and used ways ofhaving fun with your blue box. You simply dial a TSPS (Traffic ServicePositioning Station, or the operator you get when you dial '0') and blow a2600hz tone through the line. Watch out! Do not dial this direct! After youhave done that, it is quite simple to have fun with it. Blow a KP tone to starta call, a ST tone to stop it, and a 2600hz tone to hang up. Once you haveconnected to it, here are some fun numbers to call with it:0-700-456-1000  Teleconference (free, because you are the operator!)(Area code)-101 Toll Switching(Area code)-121 Local Operator (hehe)(Area code)-131 Information(Area code)-141 Rate & Route(Area code)-181 Coin Refund Operator(Area code)-11511 Conference operator (when you dial 800-544-6363) Well, those were the tone matrix controllers for the blue box and some otherhelpful stuff to help you to start out with. But those are only the functionswith the operator. There are other k-fun things you can do with it... More advanced Blue Box Stuff:   Oops. Small mistake up there. I forgot tone lengths. Um, you blow a tonepair out for up to 1/10 of a second with another 1/10 second for silencebetween the digits. KP tones should be sent for 2/10 of a second. One way toconfuse the 2600hz traps is to send pink noise over the channel (for all of youthat have decent BSR equalizers, there is major pink noise in there...)Using the operator functions is the use of the 'inward' trunk line. That isworking it from the inside. From the 'outward' trunk, you can do such things asmake emergency breakthrough calls, tap into lines, busy all of the lines in anytrunk (called 'stacking'), enable or disable the TSPS's, and for some 4asystems you can even re-route calls to anywhere. All right. The one thing that every complete phreak guide should not bewithout is blue box plans, since they were once a vital part of phreaking.Another thing that every complete file needs is a complete listing of all ofthe 800 numbers around so you can have some more fun./-/   800 Dialup Listings  /-/1-800-345-0008 (6)   1-800-547-6754 (6)1-800-245-4890 (4)   1-800-327-9136 (4)1-800-526-5305 (8)   1-800-858-9000 (3)1-800-437-9895 (7)   1-800-245-7508 (5)1-800-343-1844 (4)   1-800-322-1415 (6)1-800-437-3478 (6)   1-800-325-7222 (6)                                    Page 23                        The Official Phreaker's Manual All right, set Cat Hacker 1.0 on those numbers and have a fuck of a day. Thatis enough with 800 codes, by the time this gets around to you I dunno whatstate those codes will be in, but try them all out anyways and see what youget. On some 800 services now, they have an operator who will answer and askyou for your code, and then your name. Some will switch back and forth betweenvoice and tone verification, you can never be quite sure which you will be upagainst. Armed with this knowledge you should be having a pretty good time phreakingnow. But class isn't over yet, there are still a couple important rules thatyou should know. If you hear continual clicking on the line, then you shouldassume that an operator is messing with something, maybe even listening in onyou. It is a good idea to call someone back when the phone starts doing that.If you were using a code, use a different code and/or service to call himback. A good way to detect if a code has gone bad or not is to listen when thenumber has been dialed. If the code is bad you will probably hear the phoneringing more clearly and more quickly than if you were using a different code.If someone answers voice to it then you can immediately assume that it is anoperative for whatever company you are using. The famed '311311' code for Metrois one of those. You would have to be quite stupid to actually respond, becausewhoever you ask for the operator will always say 'He's not in right now, can Ihave him call you back?' and then they will ask for your name and phone number.Some of the more sophisticated companies will actually give you a carrier on aline that is supposed to give you a carrier and then just have garbage flowacross the screen like it would with a bad connection. That is a feeble effortto make you think that the code is still working and maybe get you to dialsomeone's voice... a good test for the carrier trick is to dial a number thatwill give you a carrier that you have never dialed with that code before, thatwill allow you to determine whether the code is good or not. For our next section, a lighter look at some of the things that a phreakshould not be without. A vocabulary. A few months ago, it was a quite strangeworld for the modem people out there. But now, a phreaker's vocabulary isessential if you wanna make a good impression on people when you post what youknow about certain subjects./-/    Vocabulary    /-/ - Do not misspell except certain exceptions:      phone -> fone      freak -> phreak - Never substitute 'z's for 's's. (i.e. codez -> codes) - Never leave many characters after a post (i.e. Hey Dudes!#!@#@!#!@) - NEVER use the 'k' prefix (k-kool, k-rad, k-whatever) - Do not abbreviate. (I got lotsa wares w/ docs) - Never substitute '0' for 'o' (r0dent, l0zer). - Forget about ye old upper case, it looks ruggyish. All right, that was to relieve the tension of what is being drilled into yourminds at the moment.. now, however, back to the teaching course. Here are somethings you should know about phones and billings for phones, etc. LATA:  Local Access Transference Area. Some people who live in large cities orareas may be plagued by this problem. For instance, let's say you live in the215 area code under the 542 prefix (Ambler, Fort Washington). If you went todial in a basic Metro code from that area, for instance, 351-0100, that mightnot be counted under unlimited local calling because it is out of your LATA.For some LATA's, you have to dial a '1' without the area code before you candial the phone number. That could prove a hassle for us all if you didn't                                    Page 24                        The Official Phreaker's Manualrealize you would be billed for that sort of call. In that way, sometimes, itis better to be safe than sorry and phreak. The Caller Log: In ESS regions, for every household around, the phone companyhas something on you called a Caller Log. This shows every single number thatyou dialed, and things can be arranged so it showed every number that wascalling to you. That's one main disadvantage of ESS, it is mostly computerizedso a number scan could be done like that quite easily. Using a dialup is aneasy way to screw that, and is something worth remembering. Anyways, with thecaller log, they check up and see what you dialed. Hmm... you dialed 15different 800 numbers that month. Soon they find that you are subscribed tonone of those companies. But that is not the only thing. Most people wouldimagine "But wait! 800 numbers don't show up on my phone bill!". To thosepeople, it is a nice thought, but 800 numbers are picked up on the caller loguntil right before they are sent off to you. So they can check right up on youbefore they send it away and can note the fact that you fucked up slightly andcalled one too many 800 lines.Right now, after all of that, you should have a pretty good idea of how to growup as a good phreak. Follow these guidelines, don't show off, and don't takeunnecessary risks when phreaking or hacking.File Level:5  /-/    Credits   /-/ To The Videosmith- for setting me straight on some shit. To The Linesman- for telling me to upload it to his AE line. To Modern Mutant- for making me into a phreaking freak. To Jack the Nibbler- for the basis of the blue box plans. By using your new k-koool (hehe) phreaking knowledge, call a couple of theseBBS's around the country: /---------------------------------X |      Bulletin Board List        | |     ---------------------       | |     215/844-8836                | | 7 Cities of Gold (3/12) 10megs  | |     307/382-4006                | | Brainstorm BBS  (3/12)          | |     612/345-2815                | | Metal Shop  (3/12)              | |     314/432-0756                | X---------------------------------/ Stay free!

Back at MIT in 1964 arrived a student by the name of Stewart Nelson,who was extremely interested in the telephone.  Before entering MIT, he hadbuilt autodialers, cheese boxes, and many more gadgets.  But when he came toMIT he became even more interested in "fone-hacking" as they called it.  Aftera little while he naturally started using the PDP-1, the schools computer atthat time, and from there he decided that it would be interesting to seewhether the computer could generate the frequencies required for blue boxing.The hackers at MIT were not interested in ripping off Ma Bell, but justexploring the telephone network.  Stew (as he was called) wrote a program togenerate all the tones and set off into the vast network.   Now there were more people phreaking than the ones at MIT.  Most people haveheard of Captain Crunch (No not the cereal), he also discovered how to takerides through the fone system, with the aid of a small whistle found in acereal box (can we guess which one?).  By blowing this whistle, he generatedthe magical 2600hz and into the mouthpiece it sailed, giving him completecontrol over the system.  I have heard rumors that at one time he made about1/4 of the calls coming out of San Francisco.  He got famous fast.  He made thecover of people magazine and was interviewed several times (as you'll soonsee).  Well he finally got caught after a long adventurous career.  After hewas caught he was put in jail and was beaten up quite badly because he wouldnot teach other inmates how to box calls.  After getting out, he joined Applecomputer and is still out there somewhere.   Then there was Joe the Whistler, blind form the day he was born.  He couldwhistle a perfect 2600hz tone.  It was rumored phreaks used to call him to tunetheir boxes.   Well that was up to about 1970, then from 1970 to 1979, phreaking was mainlydone by college students, businessmen and anyone who knew enough aboutelectronics and the fone company to make a 555 Ic to generate those magictones.  Businessmen and a few college students mainly just blue box to get freecalls.  The others were still there, exploring 800#'s and the new ESS systems.ESS posed a big problem for phreaks then and even a bigger one now.  ESS wasnot widespread, but where it was, blue boxing was next to impossible except forthe most experienced phreak.  Today ESS is installed in almost all major citiesand blue boxing is getting harder and harder.   1978 marked a change in phreaking, the Apple ][, now a computer that wasaffordable, could be programmed, and could save all that precious work on acassette.  Then just a short while later came the Apple Cat modem.  With thismodem, generating all blue box tones was easy as writing a program to countform one to ten (a little exaggerated).  Pretty soon programs that couldimitate an operator just as good as the real thing were hitting the community,TSPS and Cat's Meow, are the standard now and are the best.   1982-1986: LD services were starting to appear in mass numbers.  People nowhad programs to hack LD services, telephone exchanges, and even passwords.  Bynow many phreaks were getting extremely good and BBS's started to spring upeverywhere, each having many documentations on phreaking for the novice.  Thenit happened, the movie War Games was released and mass numbers of sixth gradeto all ages flocked to see it.  The problem wasn't that the movie was bad, itwas that now EVERYONE wanted to be a hacker/phreak.  Novices came out in suchmass numbers, that bulletin boards started to be busy 24 hours a day.  To thisday, they still have not recovered.  Other problems started to occur, novicesguessed easy passwords on large government computers and started to playaround...  Well it wasn't long before they were caught, I think that manypeople remember the 414-hackers.  They were so stupid as to say "yes" when thecomputer asked them whether they'd like to play games.  Well at least it takesthe heat off the real phreaks/hacker/krackers.                                    Page 31                        The Official Phreaker's Manual   After a little history, how about a little thrill?

These four files contain the story, "Secrets of the Little Blue Box",by Ron Rosenbaum.-A story so incredible it may even make you feel sorry for the phone company-Printed in the October 1971 issue of Esquire Magazine.  If you happen to be ina library and come across a collection of Esquire magazines, the October 1971issue is the first issue printed in the smaller format.  The story begins onpage 116 with a picture of a blue box.                                      --One Farad Cap, Atlantic Anarchist GuildThe Blue Box Is Introduced: Its Qualities Are RemarkedI am in the expensively furnished living room of Al Gilbertson (His real namehas been changed.), the creator of the "blue box." Gilbertson is holding one ofhis shiny black-and-silver "blue boxes" comfortably in the palm of his hand,pointing out the thirteen little red push buttons sticking up from the console.He is dancing his fingers over the buttons, tapping out discordant beepingelectronic jingles.  He is trying to explain to me how his little blue box doesnothing less than place the entire telephone system of the world, satellites,cables and all, at the service of the blue-box operator, free of charge."That's what it does.  Essentially it gives you the power of a super operator.You seize a tandem with this top button," he presses the top button with hisindex finger and the blue box emits a high-pitched cheep, "and like that" --cheep goes the blue box again -- "you control the phone company's long-distanceswitching systems from your cute little Princes phone or any old pay phone.And you've got anonymity.  An operator has to operate from a definite location:the phone company knows where she is and what she's doing.  But with yourbeeper box, once you hop onto a trunk, say from a Holiday Inn 800 (toll-free)number, they don't know where you are, or where you're coming from, they don'tknow how you slipped into their lines and popped up in that 800 number.  Theydon't even know anything illegal is going on.  And you can obscure your originsthrough as many levels as you like.  You can call next door by way of WhitePlains, then over to Liverpool by cable, and then back here by satellite.  Youcan call yourself from one pay phone all the way around the world to a payphone next to you.  And you get your dime back too.""And they can't trace the calls?  They can't charge you?"                                    Page 33                        The Official Phreaker's Manual"Not if you do it the right way.  But you'll find that the free-call thingisn't really as exciting at first as the feeling of power you get from havingone of these babies in your hand.  I've watched people when they first get holdof one of these things and start using it, and discover they can makeconnections, set up crisscross and zigzag switching patterns back and forthacross the world.  They hardly talk to the people they finally reach.  They sayhello and start thinking of what kind of call to make next.  They go a littlecrazy."  He looks down at the neat little package in his palm.  His fingers arestill dancing, tapping out beeper patterns."I think it's something to do with how small my models are.  There are lots ofblue boxes around, but mine are the smallest and most sophisticatedelectronically.  I wish I could show you the prototype we made for our bigsyndicate order."He sighs.  "We had this order for a thousand beeper boxes from a syndicatefront man in Las Vegas.  They use them to place bets coast to coast, keep linesopen for hours, all of which can get expensive if you have to pay.  The dealwas a thousand blue boxes for $300 apiece. Before then we retailed them for$1500 apiece, but $300,000 in one lump was hard to turn down.  We had amanufacturing deal worked out in the Philippines.  Everything ready to go.Anyway, the model I had ready for limited mass production was small enough tofit inside a flip-top Marlboro box.  It had flush touch panels for a keyboard,rather than these unsightly buttons, sticking out.  Looked just like a tinyportable radio.  In fact, I had designed it with a tiny transistor receiver toget one AM channel, so in case the law became suspicious the owner could switchon the radio part, start snapping his fingers, and no one could tell anythingillegal was going on. I thought of everything for this model -- I had it linedwith a band of thermite which could be ignited by radio signal from a tinybutton transmitter on your belt, so it could be burned to ashes instantly incase of a bust.  It was beautiful.  A beautiful little machine.  You shouldhave seen the faces on these syndicate guys when they came back after trying itout.  They'd hold it in their palm like they never wanted to let it go, andthey'd say, 'I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.'  You probably won'tbelieve it until you try it."The Blue Box Is Tested: Certain Connections Are MadeAbout eleven o'clock two nights later Fraser Lucey has a blue box in the palmof his left hand and a phone in the palm of his right.  He is standing inside aphone booth next to an isolated shut-down motel off Highway 1.  I am standingoutside the phone booth.Fraser likes to show off his blue box for people.  Until a few weeks ago whenPacific Telephone made a few arrests in his city, Fraser Lucey liked to bringhis blue box (This particular blue box, like most blue boxes, is not blue.Blue boxes have come to be called "blue boxes" either because 1) The first bluebox ever confiscated by phone-company security men happened to be blue, or 2)To distinguish them from "black boxes."  Black boxes are devices, usually aresistor in series, which, when attached to home phones, allow all incomingcalls to be made without charge to one's caller.) to parties.  It never failed:a few cheeps from his device and Fraser became the center of attention at thevery hippest of gatherings, playing phone tricks and doing request numbers forhours.  He began to take orders for his manufacturer in Mexico.  He became adealer.Fraser is cautious now about where he shows off his blue box.  But he never                                    Page 34                        The Official Phreaker's Manualgets tired of playing with it.  "It's like the first time every time," he tellsme.Fraser puts a dime in the slot.  He listens for a tone and holds the receiverup to my ear.  I hear the tone. Fraser begins describing, with a certainpracticed air, what he does while he does it. "I'm dialing an 800 number now.Any 800 number will do.  It's toll free. Tonight I think I'll use the ----- (henames a well-know rent-a-car company) 800 number.  Listen, It's ringing.  Here,you hear it?  Now watch."  He places the blue box over the mouthpiece of thephone so that the one silver and twelve black push buttons are facing up towardme.  He presses the silver button -- the one at the top -- and I hear thathigh-pitched beep. "That's 2600 cycles per second to be exact," says Lucey."Now, quick. listen."  He shoves the earpiece at me.  The ringing has vanished.The line gives a slight hiccough, there is a sharp buzz, and then nothing butsoft white noise."We're home free now," Lucey tells me, taking back the phone and applying theblue box to its mouthpiece once again.  "We're up on a tandem, into along-lines trunk.  Once you're up on a tandem, you can send yourself anywhereyou want to go."  He decides to check out London first.  He chooses a certainpay phone located in Waterloo Station.  This particular pay phone is popularwith the phone-phreaks network because there are usually people walking by atall hours who will pick it up and talk for a while.of the box. "That's Key Pulse.  It tells the tandem we're ready to give itinstructions.  First I'll punch out KP 182 START, which will slide us into theoverseas sender in White Plains."  I hear a neat clunk-cheep.  "I think we'llhead over to England by satellite. Cable is actually faster and the connectionis somewhat better, but I like going by satellite.  So I just punch out KP Zero44.  The Zero is supposed to guarantee a satellite connection and 44 is thecountry code for England.  Okay... we're there.  In Liverpool actually.  Nowall I have to do is punch out the London area code which is 1, and dial up thepay phone.  Here, listen, I've got a ring now."I hear the soft quick purr-purr of a London ring.  Then someone picks up thephone."Hello," says the London voice."Hello.  Who's this?" Fraser asks."Hello.  There's actually nobody here.  I just picked this up while I waspassing by.  This is a public phone.  There's no one here to answer actually.""Hello.  Don't hang up.  I'm calling from the United States.""Oh.  What is the purpose of the call?  This is a public phone you know.""Oh.  You know.  To check out, uh, to find out what's going on in London.  Howis it there?""Its five o'clock in the morning.  It's raining now.""Oh.  Who are you?"The London passerby turns out to be an R.A.F. enlistee on his way back to thebase in Lincolnshire, with a terrible hangover after a thirty-six-hour pass.                                    Page 35                        The Official Phreaker's ManualHe and Fraser talk about the rain.  They agree that it's nicer when it's notraining.  They say good-bye and Fraser hangs up.  His dime returns with a niceclink."Isn't that far out," he says grinning at me.  "London, like that."Fraser squeezes the little blue box affectionately in his palm.  "I told yathis thing is for real.  Listen, if you don't mind I'm gonna try this girl Iknow in Paris.  I usually give her a call around this time.  It freaks her out.This time I'll use the ------ (a different rent-a-car company) 800 number andwe'll go by overseas cable, 133; 33 is the country code for France, the 1 sendsyou by cable.  Okay, here we go.... Oh damn.  Busy.  Who could she be talkingto at this time?"A state police car cruises slowly by the motel.  The car does not stop, butFraser gets nervous.  We hop back into his car and drive ten miles in theopposite direction until we reach a Texaco station locked up for the night.  Wepull up to a phone booth by the tire pump. Fraser dashes inside and tries theParis number.  It is busy again."I don't understand who she could be talking to.  The circuits may be busy.It's too bad I haven't learned how to tap into lines overseas with this thingyet."Fraser begins to phreak around, as the phone phreaks say.  He dials a leadingnationwide charge card's 800 number and punches out the tones that bring himthe time recording in Sydney, Australia.  He beeps up the weather recording inRome, in Italian of course.  He calls a friend in Boston and talks about acertain over-the-counter stock they are into heavily.  He finds the Parisnumber busy again.  He calls up "Dial a Disc" in London, and we listen toDouble Barrel by David and Ansil Collins, the number-one hit of the week inLondon.  He calls up a dealer of another sort and talks in code.  He calls upJoe Engressia, the original blind phone-phreak genius, and pays his respects.There are other calls.  Finally Fraser gets through to his young lady inParis.They both agree the circuits must have been busy, and criticize the Paristelephone system.  At two-thirty in the morning Fraser hangs up, pockets hisdime, and drives off, steering with one hand, holding what he calls his "lovelylittle blue box" in the other.You Can Call Long Distance For Less Than You Think"You see, a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake," Gilbertsonexplains two days later in his apartment.  "They were careless enough to letsome technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all theirmulti-frequency tones.  Just a theoretical article some Bell TelephoneLaboratories engineer was doing about switching theory, and he listed the tonesin passing.  At ----- (a well-known technical school) I had been fooling aroundwith phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in theengineering library.  I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours fromthe time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box.  It wasbigger and clumsier than this little baby, but it worked."It's all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly byBell Lab people for other telephone engineers.  Or at least it was public."Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering-school library now.Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation," Gilbertson                                    Page 36                        The Official Phreaker's Manualtells me."But it's too late.  It's all public now.  And once they became public thetechnology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range of anytwelve-year-old kid, any twelve-year-old blind kid as a matter of fact.  And hecan do it in less than the twelve hours it took us.  Blind kids do it all thetime.  They can't build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box, buttheirs can do anything mine can do.""How?""Okay.  About twenty years ago A.T.&T. made a multi-billion-dollar decision tooperate its entire long-distance switching system on twelve electronicallygenerated combinations of twelve master tones. Those are the tones yousometimes hear in the background after you've dialed a long-distance number.They decided to use some very simple tones -- the tone for each number is justtwo fixed single-frequency tones played simultaneously to create a certain beatfrequency.  Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second playedtogether give you the tone for digit 5.  Now, what some of these phone phreakshave done is get themselves access to an electric organ.  Any cheap familyhome-entertainment organ.  Since the frequencies are public knowledge now --one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of the talking booksfor the blind -- they just have to find the musical notes on the organ whichcorrespond to the phone tones.  Then they tape them.  For instance, to get MaBell's tone for the number 1, you press down organ keys FD5 and AD5 (900 and700 cycles per second) at the same time.  To produce the tone for 2 it's FD5and CD6 (1100 and 700 c.p.s).  The phone phreaks circulate the whole list ofnotes so there's no trial and error anymore."He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organkeys that produce them."Actually, you have to record these notes at 3 3/4 inches-per-second tape speedand double it to 7 1/2 inches-per-second when you play them back, to get theproper tones," he adds."So once you have all the tones recorded, how do you plug them into the phonesystem?""Well, they take their organ and their cassette recorder, and start banging outentire phone numbers in tones on the organ, including country codes, routinginstructions, 'KP' and 'Start' tones.  Or, if they don't have an organ, someonein the phone-phreak network sends them a cassette with all the tones recorded,with a voice saying 'Number one,' then you have the tone, 'Number two,' thenthe tone and so on.  So with two cassette recorders they can put together aseries of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number. Anyidiot in the country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free callshe wants.""You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up the mouthpiece and switch in aseries of beeps you've recorded?  The phone thinks that anything that makesthese tones must be its own equipment?""Right.  As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second ofthe phone company's tones, the phone equipment thinks it hears its own voicetalking to it.  The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid withperfect pitch, Joe Engressia, who used to whistle into the phone.  An operatorcould tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company's                                    Page 37                        The Official Phreaker's Manualelectronic tone generator, but the phone company's switching circuit can't tellthem apart.  The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from humanoperators it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phonephreaking."A Guide for the Perplexed"But wait a minute," I stop Gilbertson.  "If everything you do sounds likephone-company equipment, why doesn't the phone company charge you for the callthe way it charges its own equipment?""Okay.  That's where the 2600-cycle tone comes in.  I better start from thebeginning."The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of thecontinent as thousands of webs, of long-line trunks radiating from each of thehundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices.  Eachtoll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of long-distance tandemsconstantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far-off toll switching offices.The tandem is the key to the whole system.  Each tandem is a line with somerelays wih the capability of signalling any other tandem in any other tollswitching office on the continent, either directly one-to-one or by programminga roundabout route through several other tandems if all the direct routes arebusy.  For instance, if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles andtraffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the two cities, your tandem inNew York is programmed to try the next best route, which may send you down to atandem in New Orleans, then up to San Francisco, or down to a New Orleanstandem, back to an Atlanta tandem, over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally upto Los Angeles.When a tandem is not being used, when it's sitting there waiting for someone tomake a long-distance call, it whistles.  One side of the tandem, the side"facing" your home phone, whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all thehome phones serviced by the exchange, telling them it is at their service,should they be interested in making a long-distance call.  The other side ofthe tandem is whistling 2600 c.p.s. into one or more long-distance trunk lines,telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving acall through that trunk at the moment, that it has no use for that trunk at themoment."When you dial a long-distance number the first thing that happens is that youare hooked into a tandem.  A register comes up to the side of the tandem facingaway from you and presents that side with the number you dialed.  This sendingside of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its trunk line.  When a tandemstops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk, the trunk is said tobe "seized," and is now ready to carry the number you have dialed -- convertedinto multi-frequency beep tones -- to a tandem in the area code and centraloffice you want.Now when a blue-box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New Yorkhe starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which might happen to have itsheadquarters in Los Angeles.  The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stopssending 2600 out over the trunk to the central office in Los Angeles, therebyseizing the trunk.  Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to atandem it has discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles.  Thereceiving end of that L.A. tandem is seized, stops whistling 2600, listens tothe beep tones which tell it which L.A. phone to ring, and starts ringing the                                    Page 38                        The Official Phreaker's Manual800 number.  Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting tapenotes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in L.A. hasbeen initiated and gives the call a code number. Everything is routine so far.But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes theover the line again andassumes that New Orleans has hung up because the trunk is whistling as if idle.The L.A. tandem immediately ceases ringing the L.A. 800 number.  But as soon asthe phreak takes his finger off the 2600 button, the L.A. tandem assumes thetrunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone, so it listens for anew series of digit tones - to find out where it must send the call.Thus the blue-box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in L.A.which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do next.  Theblue-box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tellthe L.A. tandem to relay a call to New York City.  Which it promptly does.  Assoon as your party picks up the phone in New York, the side of the New Orleanstandem facing you stops sending 2600 cycles to you and stars carrying his voiceto you by way of the L.A. tandem.  A notation is made on the accounting tapethat the connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated andnoted earlier.  When you stop talking to New York a notation is made that the800 call has ended.At three the next morning, when the phone company's accounting computer startsreading back over the master accounting tape for the past day, it records thata call of a certain length of time was made from your New Orleans home to anL.A. 800 number and, of course, the accounting computer has been trained toignore those toll-free 800 calls when compiling your monthly bill."All they can prove is that you made an 800 toll-free call," Gilbertson theinventor concludes.  "Of course, if you're foolish enough to talk for two hourson an 800 call, and they've installed one of their special anti-fraud computerprograms to watch out for such things, they may spot you and ask why you tooktwo hours talking to Army Recruiting's 800 number when you're 4-F.But if you do it from a pay phone, they may discover something peculiar thenext day -- if they've got a blue-box hunting program in their computer -- butyou'll be a long time gone from the pay phone by then.  Using a pay phone isalmost guaranteed safe.""What about the recent series of blue-box arrests all across the country -- NewYork, Cleveland, and so on?" I asked.  "How were they caught so easily?""From what I can tell, they made one big mistake: they were seizing trunksusing an area code plus 555-1212 instead of an 800 number. Using 555 is easy todetect because when you send multi-frequency beep tones of 555 you get a chargefor it on your tape and the accounting computer knows there's something wrongwhen it tries to bill you for a two-hour call to Akron, Ohio, information, andit drops a trouble card which goes right into the hands of the security agentif they're looking for blue-box user."Whoever sold those guys their blue boxes didn't tell them how to use themproperly, which is fairly irresponsible.  And they were fairly stupid to usethem at home all the time."But what those arrests really mean is than an awful lot of blue boxes areflooding into the country and that people are finding them so easy to make that                                    Page 39                        The Official Phreaker's Manualthey know how to make them before they know how to use them.  Ma Bell is introuble."And if a blue-box operator or a cassette-recorder phone phreak sticks to payphones and 800 numbers, the phone company can't stop them?"Not unless they change their entire nationwide long-lines technology, whichwill take them a few billion dollars and twenty years.  Right now they can't doa thing.  They're screwed."+-- End first file of four --+                                    Page 40                        The Official Phreaker's Manual         ***** The AAG Proudly Presents The AAG Proudly Presents *****         *                                                           *         *      +----------------------------------------------+     *         *                                                           *         *              Secrets of the Little Blue Box               *         *                                                           *         *                     by Ron Rosenbaum                      *         *                 Typed by One Farad Cap/AAG                *         *                                                           *         *        -A story so incredible it may even make you        *         *             feel sorry for the phone company-             *         *                                                           *         *                  (Second of four files)                   *         *                                                           *         *      +----------------------------------------------+     *         *                                                           *         ***** The AAG Proudly Presents The AAG Proudly Presents *****Captain Crunch Demonstrates His Famous UnitThere is an underground telephone network in this country.  Gilbertsondiscovered it the very day news of his activities hit the papers. That eveninghis phone began ringing.  Phone phreaks from Seattle, from Florida, from NewYork, from San Jose, and from Los Angeles began calling him and telling himabout the phone-phreak network.  He'd get a call from a phone phreak who'd saynothing but, "Hang up and call this number."When he dialed the number he'd find himself tied into a conference of a dozenphone phreaks arranged through a quirky switching station in British Columbia.They identified themselves as phone phreaks, they demonstrated their homemadeblue boxes which they called "M-Fers" (for "multi-frequency," among otherthings) for him, they talked shop about phone-phreak devices.  They let him inon their secrets on the theory that if the phone company was after him he mustbe trustworthy.  And, Gilbertson recalls, they stunned him with their technicalsophistication.I ask him how to get in touch with the phone-phreak network.  He digs aroundthrough a file of old schematics and comes up with about a dozen numbers inthree widely separated area codes."Those are the centers," he tells me.  Alongside some of the numbers he writesin first names or nicknames: names like Captain Crunch, Dr. No, Frank Carson(also a code word for a free call), Marty Freeman (code word for M-F device),Peter Perpendicular Pimple, Alefnull, and The Cheshire Cat.  He makes checksalongside the names of those among these top twelve who are blind.  There arefive checks.I ask him who this Captain Crunch person is."Oh.  The Captain.  He's probably the most legendary phone phreak.  He callshimself Captain Crunch after the notorious Cap'n Crunch 2600 whistle."(Several years ago, Gilbertson explains, the makers of Cap'n Crunch breakfastcereal offered a toy-whistle prize in every box as a treat for the Cap'n Crunchset.  Somehow a phone phreak discovered that the toy whistle just happened toproduce a perfect 2600-cycle tone.  When the man who calls himself CaptainCrunch was transferred overseas to England with his Air Force unit, he wouldreceive scores of calls from his friends and "mute" them -- make them free ofcharge to them -- by blowing his Cap'n Crunch whistle into his end.)                                    Page 41                        The Official Phreaker's Manual"Captain Crunch is one of the older phone phreaks," Gilbertson tells me.  "He'san engineer who once got in a little trouble for fooling around with the phone,but he can't stop.  Well, they guy drives across country in a Volkswagen vanwith an entire switchboard and a computerized super-sophisticated M-F-er in theback.  He'll pull up to a phone booth on a lonely highway somewhere, snake acable out of his bus, hook it onto the phone and sit for hours, days sometimes,sending calls zipping back and forth across the country, all over theworld...."Back at my motel, I dialed the number he gave me for "Captain Crunch" and askedfor G---- T-----, his real name, or at least the name he uses when he's notdashing into a phone booth beeping out M-F tones faster than a speeding bulletand zipping phantomlike through the phone company's long-distance lines.When G---- T----- answered the phone and I told him I was preparing a story forEsquire about phone phreaks, he became very indignant."I don't do that.  I don't do that anymore at all.  And if I do it, I do it forone reason and one reason only.  I'm learning about a system.  The phonecompany is a System.  A computer is a System, do you understand?  If I do whatI do, it is only to explore a system. Computers, systems, that's my bag.  Thephone company is nothing but a computer."A tone of tightly restrained excitement enters the Captain's voice when hestarts talking about systems.  He begins to pronounce each syllable with thehushed deliberation of an obscene caller."Ma Bell is a system I want to explore.  It's a beautiful system, you know, butMa Bell screwed up.  It's terrible because Ma Bell is such a beautiful system,but she screwed up.  I learned how she screwed up from a couple of blind kidswho wanted me to build a device.  A certain device.  They said it could makefree calls.  I wasn't interested in free calls.  But when these blind kids toldme I could make calls into a computer, my eyes lit up.  I wanted to learn aboutcomputers.  I wanted to learn about Ma Bell's computers.  So I build the littledevice, but I built it wrong and Ma Bell found out.  Ma Bell can detect thingslike that.  Ma Bell knows.  So I'm strictly rid of it now.  I don't do it.Except for learning purposes."  He pauses. "So you want to write an article.Are you paying for this call?  Hang up and call this number."  He gives me anumber in a area code a thousand miles away of his own.  I dial the number."Hello again.  This is Captain Crunch.  You are speaking to me on a toll-freeloop-around in Portland, Oregon.  Do you know what a toll-free loop around is?I'll tell you.He explains to me that almost every exchange in the country has open testnumbers which allow other exchanges to test their connections with it.  Most ofthese numbers occur in consecutive pairs, such as 302 956-0041 and 302956-0042.  Well, certain phone phreaks discovered that if two people fromanywhere in the country dial the two consecutive numbers they can talk togetherjust as if one had called the other's number, with no charge to either of them,of course."Now our voice is looping around in a 4A switching machine up there in Canada,zipping back down to me," the Captain tells me.  "My voice is looping around upthere and back down to you.  And it can't ever cost anyone money.  The phonephreaks and I have compiled a list of many many of these numbers.  You would besurprised if you saw the list.  I could show it to you.  But I won't.  I'm out                                    Page 42                        The Official Phreaker's Manualof that now.  I'm not out to screw Ma Bell.  I know better.  If I do anythingit's for the pure knowledge of the System.  You can learn to do fantasticthings.  Have you ever heard eight tandems stacked up?  Do you know the soundof tandems stacking and unstacking?  Give me your phone number.  Okay. Hang upnow and wait a minute."Slightly less than a minute later the phone rang and the Captain was on theline, his voice sounding far more excited, almost aroused."I wanted to show you what it's like to stack up tandems.  To stack uptandems." (Whenever the Captain says "stack up" it sounds as if he is lickinghis lips.)"How do you like the connection you're on now?" the Captain asks me. "It's araw tandem.  A raw tandem.  Ain't nothin' up to it but a tandem.  Now I'm goingto show you what it's like to stack up.  Blow off.  Land in a far away place.To stack that tandem up, whip back and forth across the country a few times,then shoot on up to Moscow."Listen," Captain Crunch continues.  "Listen.  I've got line tie on myswitchboard here, and I'm gonna let you hear me stack and unstack tandems.Listen to this.  It's gonna blow your mind."First I hear a super rapid-fire pulsing of the flutelike phone tones, then apause, then another popping burst of tones, then another, then another.  Eachburst is followed by a beep-kachink sound."We have now stacked up four tandems," said Captain Crunch, sounding somewhatremote.  "That's four tandems stacked up.  Do you know what that means?  Thatmeans I'm whipping back and forth, back and forth twice, across the country,before coming to you.  I've been known to stack up twenty tandems at a time.Now, just like I said, I'm going to shoot up to Moscow."There is a new, longer series of beeper pulses over the line, a brief silence,then a ring."Hello," answers a far-off voice."Hello.  Is this the American Embassy Moscow?"Moscow?""Okay?""Well, yes, how are things there?""Oh.  Well, everything okay, I guess.""Okay.  Thank you."They hang up, leaving a confused series of beep-kachink sounds hanging inmid-ether in the wake of the call before dissolving away.The Captain is pleased.  "You believe me now, don't you?  Do you know what I'd                                    Page 43                        The Official Phreaker's Manuallike to do?  I'd just like to call up your editor at Esquire and show him justwhat it sounds like to stack and unstack tandems. I'll give him a show thatwill blow his mind.  What's his number?I ask the Captain what kind of device he was using to accomplish all his feats.The Captain is pleased at the question."You could tell it was special, couldn't you?"  Ten pulses per second. That'sfaster than the phone company's equipment.  Believe me, this unit is the mostfamous unit in the country.  There is no other unit like it.  Believe me.""Yes, I've heard about it.  Some other phone phreaks have told me about it.""They have been referring to my, ahem, unit?  What is it they said? Just out ofcuriosity, did they tell you it was a highly sophisticated computer-operatedunit, with acoustical coupling for receiving outputs and a switch-board withmultiple-line-tie capability?  Did they tell you that the frequency toleranceis guaranteed to be not more than .05 percent?  The amplitude tolerance lessthan .01 decibel?  Those pulses you heard were perfect.  They just come fasterthan the phone company. Those were high-precision op-amps.  Op-amps areinstrumentation amplifiers designed for ultra-stable amplification, super-lowdistortion and accurate frequency response.  Did they tell you it can operatein temperatures from -55 degrees C to +125 degrees C?"I admit that they did not tell me all that."I built it myself," the Captain goes on.  "If you were to go out and buy thecomponents from an industrial wholesaler it would cost you at least $1500.  Ionce worked for a semiconductor company and all this didn't cost me a cent.  Doyou know what I mean?  Did they tell you about how I put a call completelyaround the world?  I'll tell you how I did it.  I M-Fed Tokyo inward, whoconnected me to India, India connected me to Greece, Greece connected me toPretoria, South Africa, South Africa connected me to South America, I went fromSouth America to London, I had a London operator connect me to a New Yorkoperator, I had New York connect me to a California operator who rang the phonenext to me.  Needless to say I had to shout to hear myself.  But the echo wasfar out.  Fantastic.  Delayed.  It was delayed twenty seconds, but I could hearmyself talk to myself.""You mean you were speaking into the mouthpiece of one phone sending your voicearound the world into your ear through a phone on the other side of your head?"I asked the Captain.  I had a vision of something vaguely autoerotic going on,in a complex electronic way."That's right," said the Captain.  "I've also sent my voice around the worldone way, going east on one phone, and going west on the other, going throughcable one way, satellite the other, coming back together at the same time,ringing the two phones simultaneously and picking them up and whipping myvoice both ways around the world back to me. Wow.  That was a mind blower.""You mean you sit there with both phones on your ear and talk to yourselfaround the world," I said incredulously."Yeah.  Um hum.  That's what I do.  I connect the phone together and sit thereand talk.""What do you say?  What do you say to yourself when you're connected?"                                    Page 44                        The Official Phreaker's Manual"Oh, you know.  Hello test one two three," he says in a low-pitched voice."Hello test one two three," he replied to himself in a high-pitched voice."Hello test one two three," he repeats again, low-pitched."Hello test one two three," he replies, high-pitched."I sometimes do this: Hello Hello Hello Hello, Hello, hello," he trails off andbreaks into laughter.Why Captain Crunch Hardly Ever Taps Phones AnymoreUsing internal phone-company codes, phone phreaks have learned a simple methodfor tapping phones.  Phone-company operators have in front of them a board thatholds verification jacks.  It allows them to plug into conversations in case ofemergency, to listen in to a line to determine if the line is busy or thecircuits are busy.  Phone phreaks have learned to beep out the codes which leadthem to a verification operator, tell the verification operator they areswitchmen from some other area code testing out verification trunks. Once theoperator hooks them into the verification trunk, they disappear into the boardfor all practical purposes, slip unnoticed into any one of the 10,000 to100,000 numbers in that central office without the verification operatorknowing what they're doing, and of course without the two parties to theconnection knowing there is a phantom listener present on their line.Toward the end of my hour-long first conversation with him, I asked the Captainif he ever tapped phones."Oh no.  I don't do that.  I don't think it's right," he told me firmly.  "Ihave the power to do it but I don't... Well one time, just one time, I have toadmit that I did.  There was this girl, Linda, and I wanted to find out... youknow.  I tried to call her up for a date. I had a date with her the lastweekend and I thought she liked me.  I called her up, man, and her line wasbusy, and I kept calling and it was still busy.  Well, I had just learned aboutthis system of jumping into lines and I said to myself, 'Hmmm.  Why not justsee if it works. It'll surprise her if all of a sudden I should pop up on herline. It'll impress her, if anything.'  So I went ahead and did it.  I M-Fedinto the line.  My M-F-er is powerful enough when patched directly into themouthpiece to trigger a verification trunk without using an operator the waythe other phone phreaks have to."I slipped into the line and there she was talking to another boyfriend.Making sweet talk to him.  I didn't make a sound because I was so disgusted.So I waited there for her to hang up, listening to her making sweet talk to theother guy.  You know.  So as soon as she hung up I instantly M-F-ed her up andall I said was, 'Linda, we're through.'  And I hung up.  And it blew her headoff.  She couldn't figure out what the hell happened."But that was the only time.  I did it thinking I would surprise her, impressher.  Those were all my intentions were, and well, it really kind of hurt mepretty badly, and... and ever since then I don't go into verification trunks."Moments later my first conversation with the Captain comes to a close."Listen," he says, his spirits somewhat cheered, "listen.  What you are goingto hear when I hang up is the sound of tandems unstacking. Layer after layer oftandems unstacking until there's nothing left of the stack, until it melts away                                    Page 45                        The Official Phreaker's Manualinto nothing.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep," he concludes, his voice descendingto a whisper with each cheep.He hangs up.  The phone suddenly goes into four spasms: kachink cheep. Kachinkcheep kachink cheep kachink cheep, and the complex connection has wiped itselfout like the Cheshire cat's smile.The MF Boogie BluesThe next number I choose from the select list of phone-phreak alumni, preparedfor me by the blue-box inventor, is a Memphis number.  It is the number of JoeEngressia, the first and still perhaps the most accomplished blind phonephreak.Three years ago Engressia was a nine-day wonder in newspapers and magazines allover America because he had been discovered whistling free long-distanceconnections for fellow students at the University of South Florida.  Engressiawas born with perfect pitch: he could whistle phone tones better than thephone-company's equipment.Engressia might have gone on whistling in the dark for a few friends for therest of his life if the phone company hadn't decided to expose him.  He waswarned, disciplined by the college, and the whole case became public.  In themonths following media reports of his talent, Engressia began receiving strangecalls.   There were calls from a group of kids in Los Angeles who could do somevery strange things with the quirky General Telephone and Electronics circuitryin L.A. suburbs.  There were calls from a group of mostly blind kids in ----,California, who had been doing some interesting experiments with Cap'n Crunchwhistles and test loops.  There was a group in Seattle, a group in Cambridge,Massachusetts, a few from New York, a few scattered across the country.  Someof them had already equipped themselves with cassette and electronic M-Fdevices.  For some of these groups, it was the first time they knew of theothers.The exposure of Engressia was the catalyst that linked the separatephone-phreak centers together.  They all called Engressia.  They talked to himabout what he was doing and what they were doing.  And then he told them -- thescattered regional centers and lonely independent phone phreakers -- about eachother, gave them each other's numbers to call, and within a year the scatteredphone-phreak centers had grown into a nationwide underground.Joe Engressia is only twenty-two years old now, but along the phone-phreaknetwork he is "the old man," accorded by phone phreaks something of thereverence the phone company bestows on Alexander Graham Bell.  He seldom needsto make calls anymore.  The phone phreaks all call him and let him know whatnew tricks, new codes, new techniques they have learned.  Every night he sitslike a sightless spider in his little apartment receiving messages from everytendril of his web.  It is almost a point of pride with Joe that they callhim.But when I reached him in his Memphis apartment that night, Joe Engressia waslonely, jumpy and upset."God, I'm glad somebody called.  I don't know why tonight of all nights I don'tget any calls.  This guy around here got drunk again tonight and propositionedme again.  I keep telling him we'll never see eye to eye on this subject, ifyou know what I mean.  I try to make light of it, you know, but he doesn't getit.  I can head him out there getting drunker and I don't know what he'll do                                    Page 46                        The Official Phreaker's Manualnext.  It's just that I'm really all alone here, just moved to Memphis, it'sthe first time I'm living on my own, and I'd hate for it to all collapse now.But I won't go to bed with him.  I'm just not very interested in sex and evenif I can't see him I know he's ugly."Did you hear that?  That's him banging a bottle against the wall outside.He's nice.  Well forget about it.  You're doing a story on phone phreaks?Listen to this.  It's the MF Boogie Blues.Sure enough, a jumpy version of Muskrat Ramble boogies its way over the line,each note one of those long-distance phone tones.  The music stops.  A hugeroaring voice blasts the phone off my ear: "AND THE QUESTION IS..." roars thevoice, "CAN A BLIND PERSON HOOK UP AN AMPLIFIER ON HIS OWN?"The roar ceases.  A high-pitched operator-type voice replaces it. "This isSouthern Braille Tel. & Tel.  Have tone, will phone."This is succeeded by a quick series of M-F tones, a swift "kachink" and a deepreassuring voice: "If you need home care, call the visiting-nurses association.First National time in Honolulu is 4:32 p.m."Joe back in his Joe voice again: "Are we seeing eye to eye? 'Si, si,' said theblind Mexican.  Ahem.  Yes.  Would you like to know the weather in Tokyo?"This swift manic sequence of phone-phreak vaudeville stunts and blind-boy jokesmanages to keep Joe's mind off his tormentor only as long as it lasts."The reason I'm in Memphis, the reason I have to depend on that homosexual guy,is that this is the first time I've been able to live on my own and make phonetrips on my own.  I've been banned from all central offices around home inFlorida, they knew me too well, and at the University some of my fellowscholars were always harassing me because I was on the dorm pay phone all thetime and making fun of me because of my fat ass, which of course I do have,it's my physical fatness program, but I don't like to hear it every day, and ifI can't phone trip and I can't phone phreak, I can't imagine what I'd do, I'vebeen devoting three quarters of my life to it."I moved to Memphis because I wanted to be on my own as well as because it hasa Number 5 crossbar switching system and some interesting little independentphone-company districts nearby and so far they don't seem to know who I am so Ican go on phone tripping, and for me phone tripping is just as important asphone phreaking."Phone tripping, Joe explains, begins with calling up a central-office switchroom.  He tells the switchman in a polite earnest voice that he's a blindcollege student interested in telephones, and could he perhaps have a guidedtour of the switching station?  Each step of the tour Joe likes to touch andfeel relays, caress switching circuits, switchboards, crossbar arrangements.So when Joe Engressia phone phreaks he feels his way through the circuitry ofthe country garden of forking paths, he feels switches shift, relays shunt,crossbars swivel, tandems engage and disengage even as he hears -- with perfectpitch -- his M-F pulses make the entire Bell system dance to his tune.Just one month ago Joe took all his savings out of his bank and left home, overthe emotional protests of his mother.  "I ran away from home almost," he likesto say.  Joe found a small apartment house on Union Avenue and began makingphone trips.  He'd take a bus a hundred miles south in Mississippi to see some                                    Page 47                        The Official Phreaker's Manualold-fashioned Bell equipment still in use in several states, which had beenpuzzling.  He'd take a bus three hundred miles to Charlotte, North Carolina, tolook at some brand-new experimental equipment.  He hired a taxi to drive himtwelve miles to a suburb to tour the office of a small phone company with someinteresting idiosyncrasies in its routing system.  He was having the time ofhis life, he said, the most freedom and pleasure he had known.In that month he had done very little long-distance phone phreaking from hisown phone.  He had begun to apply for a job with the phone company, he told me,and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal."Any kind of job will do, anything as menial as the most lowly operator.That's probably all they'd give me because I'm blind.  Even though I probablyknow more than most switchmen.  But that's okay.  I want to work for Ma Bell.I don't hate Ma Bell the way Gilbertson and some phone phreaks do.  I don'twant to screw Ma Bell.  With me it's the pleasure of pure knowledge.  There'ssomething beautiful about the system when you know it intimately the way I do.But I don't know how much they know about me here.  I have a very intuitivefeel for the condition of the line I'm on, and I think they're monitoring meoff and on lately, but I haven't been doing much illegal.  I have to make a fewcalls to switchmen once in a while which aren't strictly legal, and once I tookan acid trip and was having these auditory hallucinations as if I were trappedand these planes were dive-bombing me, and all of sudden I had to phone phreakout of there.  For some reason I had to call Kansas City, but that's all."A Warning Is DeliveredAt this point -- one o'clock in my time zone -- a loud knock on my motel-roomdoor interrupts our conversation.  Outside the door I find a uniformed securityguard who informs me that there has been an "emergency phone call" for me whileI have been on the line and that the front desk has sent him up to let meknow.Two seconds after I say good-bye to Joe and hang up, the phone rings."Who were you talking to?" the agitated voice demands.  The voice belongs toCaptain Crunch.  "I called because I decided to warn you of something.  Idecided to warn you to be careful.  I don't want this information you get toget to the radical underground.  I don't want it to get into the wrong hands.What would you say if I told you it's possible for three phone phreaks tosaturate the phone system of the nation.  Saturate it.  Busy it out.  All ofit.  I know how to do this.  I'm not gonna tell.  A friend of mine has alreadysaturated the trunks between Seattle and New York.  He did it with acomputerized M-F-er hitched into a special Manitoba exchange.  But there areother, easier ways to do it."Just three people?  I ask.  How is that possible?"Have you ever heard of the long-lines guard frequency?  Do you know aboutstacking tandems with 17 and 2600?  Well, I'd advise you to find out about it.I'm not gonna tell you.  But whatever you do, don't let this get into the handsof the radical underground."(Later Gilbertson, the inventor, confessed that while he had always beenskeptical about the Captain's claim of the sabotage potential of trunk-tyingphone phreaks, he had recently heard certain demonstrations which convinced himthe Captain was not speaking idly. "I think it might take more than threepeople, depending on how many machines like Captain Crunch's were available.                                    Page 48                        The Official Phreaker's ManualBut even though the Captain sounds a little weird, he generally turns out toknow what he's talking about.")"You know," Captain Crunch continues in his admonitory tone, "you know theyounger phone phreaks call Moscow all the time.  Suppose everybody were to callMoscow.  I'm no right-winger.  But I value my life.  I don't want the Commiescoming over and dropping a bomb on my head. That's why I say you've got to becareful about who gets this information."The Captain suddenly shifts into a diatribe against those phone phreaks whodon't like the phone company."They don't understand, but Ma Bell knows everything they do.  Ma Bell knows.Listen, is this line hot?  I just heard someone tap in.  I'm not paranoid, butI can detect things like that.  Well, even if it is, they know that I know thatthey know that I have a bulk eraser.  I'm very clean."  The Captain pauses,evidently torn between wanting to prove to the phone-company monitors that hedoes nothing illegal, and the desire to impress Ma Bell with his prowess.  "MaBell knows how good I am.  And I am quite good.  I can detect reversals, tandemswitching, everything that goes on on a line.  I have relative pitch now.  Doyou know what that means?  My ears are a $20,000 piece of equipment.  With myears I can detect things they can't hear with their equipment.  I've hademployment problems.  I've lost jobs.  But I want to show Ma Bell how good Iam.  I don't want to screw her, I want to work for her.  I want to do good forher.  I want to help her get rid of her flaws and become perfect.  That's mynumber-one goal in life now."  The Captain concludes his warnings and tells mehe has to be going.  "I've got a little action lined up for tonight," heexplains and hangs up.Before I hang up for the night, I call Joe Engressia back.  He reports that histormentor has finally gone to sleep -- "He's not blind drunk, that's the way Iget, ahem, yes; but you might say he's in a drunken stupor."  I make a date tovisit Joe in Memphis in two days.+-- End second file of four --+                                    Page 49                        The Official Phreaker's Manual         ***** The AAG Proudly Presents The AAG Proudly Presents *****         *                                                           *         *      +----------------------------------------------+     *         *                                                           *         *              Secrets of the Little Blue Box               *         *                                                           *         *                     by Ron Rosenbaum                      *         *                 Typed by One Farad Cap/AAG                *         *                                                           *         *        -A story so incredible it may even make you        *         *             feel sorry for the phone company-             *         *                                                           *         *                  (Third of four files)                    *         *                                                           *         *      +----------------------------------------------+     *         *                                                           *         ***** The AAG Proudly Presents The AAG Proudly Presents *****A Phone Phreak Call Takes Care of BusinessThe next morning I attend a gathering of four phone phreaks in  ----- (aCalifornia suburb).  The gathering takes place in a comfortable split-levelhome in an upper-middle-class subdivision.  Heaped on the kitchen table are theportable cassette recorders, M-F cassettes, phone patches, and line ties of thefour phone phreaks present.  On the kitchen counter next to the telephone is ashoe-box-size blue box with thirteen large toggle switches for the tones.  Theparents of the host phone phreak, Ralph, who is blind, stay in the living roomwith their sighted children.  They are not sure exactly what Ralph and hisfriends do with the phone or if it's strictly legal, but he is blind and theyare pleased he has a hobby which keeps him busy.The group has been working at reestablishing the historic "2111" conference,reopening some toll-free loops, and trying to discover the dimensions of whatseem to be new initiatives against phone phreaks by phone-company securityagents.It is not long before I get a chance to see, to hear, Randy at work. Randy isknown among the phone phreaks as perhaps the finest con man in the game.  Randyis blind.  He is pale, soft and pear-shaped, he wears baggy pants and a wrinklynylon white sport shirt, pushes his head forward from hunched shoulderssomewhat like a turtle inching out of its shell.  His eyes wander, crossing andrecrossing, and his forehead is somewhat pimply.  He is only sixteen yearsold.But when Randy starts speaking into a telephone mouthpiece his voice becomes sostunningly authoritative it is necessary to look again to convince yourself itcomes from a chubby adolescent Randy.  Imagine the voice of a crack oil-rigforeman, a tough, sharp, weather-beaten Marlboro man of forty.  Imagine thevoice of a brilliant performance-fund gunslinger explaining how he beats theDow Jones by thirty percent.  Then imagine a voice that could make those twoHe is speaking to a switchman in Detroit.  The phone company in Detroit hadclosed up two toll-free loop pairs for no apparent reason, although heavy useby phone phreaks all over the country may have been detected.  Randy is tellingthe switchman how to open up the loop and make it free again:"How are you, buddy.  Yeah. I'm on the board in here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and                                    Page 50                        The Official Phreaker's Manualwe've been trying to run some tests on your loop-arounds and we find'em busiedout on both sides....

Oh that'sokay, we've had this trouble before, we may have to go after the circuit.  Herelemme give 'em to you: your frame is 05, vertical group 03, horizontal 5,vertical file 3.  Yeah, we'll hang on here.... Okay, found it?  Good.  Right,yeah, we'd like to clear that busy out.  Right.  All you have to do is look foryour key on the mounting plate, it's in your miscellaneous trunk frame.  Okay?Right.  Now pull your key from NOR over the LCT.  Yeah. I don't know why thathappened, but we've been having trouble with that one.  Okay.  Thanks a lotfella.  Be seein' ya."Randy hangs up, reports that the switchman was a little inexperienced with theloop-around circuits on the miscellaneous trunk frame, but that the loop hasbeen returned to its free-call status.Delighted, phone phreak Ed returns the pair of numbers to the active-statuscolumn in his directory.  Ed is a superb and painstaking researcher.  Withalmost Talmudic thoroughness he will trace tendrils of hints through soft-wiredmazes of intervening phone-company circuitry back through complex linkages ofswitching relays to find the location and identity of just one toll-free loop.He spends hours and hours, every day, doing this sort of thing.  He has somehowcompiled a directory of eight hundred "Band-six in-WATS numbers" located inover forty states.  Band-six in-WATS numbers are the big 800 numbers -- theones that can be dialed into free from anywhere in the country.Ed the researcher, a nineteen-year-old engineering student, is also a superbtechnician.  He put together his own working blue box from scratch at ageseventeen.  (He is sighted.)  This evening after distributing the latest issueof his in-WATS directory (which has been typed into Braille for the blind phonephreaks), he announces he has made a major new breakthrough:"I finally tested it and it works, perfectly. I've got this switching matrixwhich converts any touch-tone phone into an M-F-er."The tones you hear in touch-tone phones are not the M-F tones that operate thelong-distance switching system.  Phone phreaks believe A.T.&T. had deliberatelyequipped touch tones with a  different set of frequencies to avoid putting thesix master M-F tones in the hands of every touch-tone owner.  Ed's complexswitching matrix puts the six master tones, in effect put a blue box, in thehands of every touch-tone owner.Ed shows me pages of schematics, specifications and parts lists. "It's not easyto build, but everything here is in the Heathkit catalog."Ed asks Ralph what progress he has made in his attempts to reestablish along-term open conference line for phone phreaks.  The last big conference --the historic "2111" conference -- had been arranged through an unused Telextest-board trunk somewhere in the innards of a 4A switching machine inVancouver, Canada.  For months phone phreaks could M-F their way intoVancouver, beep out 604 (the Vancouver area code) and then beep out 2111 (theinternal phone-company code for Telex testing), and find themselves at anytime, day or night, on an open wire talking with an array of phone phreaks fromcoast to coast, operators from Bermuda, Tokyo and London who are phone-phreaksympathizers, and miscellaneous guests and technical experts.  The conferencewas a massive exchange of information.  Phone phreaks picked each other'sbrains clean, then developed new ways to pick the phone company's brains clean.Ralph gave M F Boogies concerts with his home-entertainment-type electric                                    Page 51                        The Official Phreaker's Manualorgan, Captain Crunch demonstrated his round-the-world prowess with hisnotorious computerized unit and dropped leering hints of the "action" he wasgetting with his girl friends.  (The Captain lives out or pretends to live outseveral kinds of fantasies to the gossipy delight of the blind phone phreakswho urge him on to further triumphs on behalf of all of them.)  The somewhatrowdy Northwest phone-phreak crowd let their bitter internal feud spill overinto the peaceable conference line, escalating shortly into guerrilla warfare;Carl the East Coast international tone relations expert demonstrated newlyopened direct M-F routes to central offices on the island of Bahrein in thePersian Gulf, introduced a new phone-phreak friend of his in Pretoria, andexplained the technical operation of the new Oakland-to Vietnam linkages.(Many phone phreaks pick up spending money by M-F-ing calls from relatives toVietnam G.I.'s, charging $5 for a whole hour of trans-Pacific conversation.)Day and night the conference line was never dead.  Blind phone phreaks all overthe country, lonely and isolated in homes filled with active sighted brothersand sisters, or trapped with slow and unimaginative blind kids in straitjacketschools for the blind, knew that no matter how late it got they could dial upthe conference and find instant electronic communion with two or three otherblind kids awake over on the other side of America.  Talking together on aphone hookup, the blind phone phreaks say, is not much different from beingthere together. Physically, there was nothing more than a two-inch-square waferof titanium inside a vast machine on Vancouver Island.  For the blind kids>there< meant an exhilarating feeling of being in touch, through a kind ofskill and magic which was peculiarly their own.Last April 1, however, the long Vancouver Conference was shut off. The phonephreaks knew it was coming.  Vancouver was in the process of converting from astep-by-step system to a 4A machine and the 2111 Telex circuit was to be wipedout in the process.  The phone phreaks learned the actual day on which theconference would be erased about a week ahead of time over the phone company'sinternal-news-and-shop-talk recording.For the next frantic seven days every phone phreak in America was on and offthe 2111 conference twenty-four hours a day.  Phone phreaks who were justlearning the game or didn't have M-F capability were boosted up to theconference by more experienced phreaks so they could get a glimpse of what itwas like before it disappeared.  Top phone phreaks searched distant area codesfor new conference possibilities without success.  Finally in the early morningof April 1, the end came."I could feel it coming a couple hours before midnight," Ralph remembers.  "Youcould feel something going on in the lines.  Some static began showing up, thensome whistling wheezing sound.  Then there were breaks.  Some people got cutoff and called right back in, but after a while some people were finding theywere cut off and couldn't get back in at all.  It was terrible.  I lost itabout one a.m., but managed to slip in again and stay on until the thingdied... I think it was about four in the morning.  There were four of us stillhanging on when the conference disappeared into nowhere for good.  We all triedto M-F up to it again of course, but we got silent termination.  There wasnothing there."The Legendary Mark Bernay Turns Out To Be "The Midnight Skulker"Mark Bernay.  I had come across that name before.  It was on Gilbertson'sselect list of phone phreaks.  The California phone phreaks had spoken of amysterious Mark Bernay as perhaps the first and oldest phone phreak on the WestCoast.  And in fact almost every phone phreak in the West can trace his origins                                    Page 52                        The Official Phreaker's Manualeither directly to Mark Bernay or to a disciple of Mark Bernay.It seems that five years ago this Mark Bernay (a pseudonym he chose forhimself) began traveling up and down the West Coast pasting tiny stickers inphone books all along his way.  The stickers read something like "Want to hearan interesting tape recording? Call these numbers."  The numbers that followedwere toll-free loop-around pairs. When one of the curious called one of thenumbers he would hear a tape recording pre-hooked into the loop by Bernay whichexplained the use of loop-around pairs, gave the numbers of several more, andended by telling the caller, "At six o'clock tonight this recording will stopand you and your friends can try it out.  Have fun.""I was disappointed by the response at first," Bernay told me, when I finallyreached him at one of his many numbers and he had dispensed with the usual "Inever do anything illegal" formalities which experienced phone phreaks openmost conversations."I went all over the coast with these stickers not only on pay phones, but I'dthrow them in front of high schools in the middle of the night, I'd leave themunobtrusively in candy stores, scatter them on main streets of small towns.  Atfirst hardly anyone bothered to try it out.  I would listen in for hours andhours after six o'clock and no one came on.  I couldn't figure out why peoplewouldn't be interested.  Finally these two girls in Oregon tried it out andtold all their friends and suddenly it began to spread."Before his Johny Appleseed trip Bernay had already gathered a sizable group ofearly pre-blue-box phone phreaks together on loop-arounds in Los Angeles.Bernay does not claim credit for the original discovery of the loop-aroundnumbers.  He attributes the discovery to an eighteen-year-old reform school kidin Long Beach whose name he forgets and who, he says, "just disappeared oneday."  When Bernay himself discovered loop-arounds independently, from clues inhis readings in old issues of the Automatic Electric Technical Journal, hefound dozens of the reform-school kid's friends already using them. However, itwas one of Bernay's disciples in Seattle that introduced phone phreaking toblind kids.  The Seattle kid who learned about loops through Bernay's recordingtold a blind friend, the blind kid taught the secret to his friends at a wintercamp for blind kids in Los Angeles.  When the camp session was over these kidstook the secret back to towns all over the West.  This is how the originalblind kids became phone phreaks.  For them, for most phone phreaks in general,it was the discovery of the possibilities of loop-arounds which led them on tofar more serious and sophisticated phone-phreak methods, and which gave them amedium for sharing their discoveries.A year later a blind kid who moved back east brought the technique to a blindkids' summer camp in Vermont, which spread it along the East Coast.  All from aMark Bernay sticker.Bernay, who is nearly thirty years old now, got his start when he was fifteenand his family moved into an L.A. suburb serviced by General Telephone andElectronics equipment.  He became fascinated with the differences between Belland G.T.&E. equipment.  He learned he could make interesting things happen bycarefully timed clicks with the disengage button.  He learned to interpretsubtle differences in the array of clicks, whirrs and kachinks he could hear onhis lines.  He learned he could shift himself around the switching relays ofthe L.A. area code in a not-too-predictable fashion by interspersing his ownhook-switch clicks with the clicks within the line. (Independent phonecompanies -- there are nineteen hundred of them still left, most of them tinyisland principalities in Ma Bell's vast empire -- have always been favorites                                    Page 53                        The Official Phreaker's Manualwith phone phreaks, first as learning tools, then as Archimedes platforms fromwhich to manipulate the huge Bell system.  A phone phreak in Bell territorywill often M-F himself into an independent's switching system, with switchingidiosyncrasies which can give him marvelous leverage over the Bell System."I have a real affection for Automatic Electric Equipment," Bernay told me."There are a lot of things you can play with.  Things break down in interestingways."Shortly after Bernay graduated from college (with a double major in chemistryand philosophy), he graduated from phreaking around with G.T.&E. to the BellSystem itself, and made his legendary sticker-pasting journey north along thecoast, settling finally in Northwest Pacific Bell territory.  He discoveredthat if Bell does not break down as interestingly as G.T.&E., it neverthelessoffers a lot of "things to play with."Bernay learned to play with blue boxes.  He established his own personalswitchboard and phone-phreak research laboratory complex.  He continued hisphone-phreak evangelism with ongoing sticker campaigns. He set up two recordingnumbers, one with instructions for beginning phone phreaks, the other withlatest news and technical developments (along with some advanced instruction)gathered from sources all over the country.These days, Bernay told me, he had gone beyond phone-phreaking itself. "LatelyI've been enjoying playing with computers more than playing with phones.  Mypersonal thing in computers is just like with phones, I guess -- the kick is infinding out how to beat the system, how to get at things I'm not supposed toknow about, how to do things with the system that I'm not supposed to be ableto do."As a matter of fact, Bernay told me, he had just been fired from hiscomputer-programming job for doing things he was not supposed to be able to do.he had been working with a huge time-sharing computer owned by a largecorporation but shared by many others.  Access to the computer was limited tothose programmers and corporations that had been assigned certain passwords.And each password restricted its user to access to only the one section of thecomputer cordoned off from its own information storager.  The password systemprevented companies and individuals from stealing each other's information."I figured out how to write a program that would let me read everyone else'spassword," Bernay reports.  "I began playing around with passwords.  I beganletting the people who used the computer know, in subtle ways, that I knewtheir passwords.  I began dropping notes to the computer supervisors with hintsthat I knew what I know. I signed them 'The Midnight Skulker.'  I kept gettingcleverer and cleverer with my messages and devising ways of showing them what Icould do. I'm sure they couldn't imagine I could do the things I was showingthem.  But they never responded to me.  Every once in a while they'd change thepasswords, but I found out how to discover what the new ones were, and I letthem know.  But they never responded directly to the Midnight Skulker.  I evenfinally designed a program which they could use to prevent my program fromfinding out what it did.  In effect I told them how to wipe me out, TheMidnight Skulker.  It was a very clever program.  I started leaving clues aboutmyself.  I wanted them to try and use it and then try to come up with somethingto get around that and reappear again.  But they wouldn't play.  I wanted toget caught.  I mean I didn't want to get caught personally, but I wanted themto notice me and admit that they noticed me.  I wanted them to attempt torespond, maybe in some interesting way."                                    Page 54                        The Official Phreaker's ManualFinally the computer managers became concerned enough about the threat ofinformation-stealing to respond.  However, instead of using The MidnightSkulker's own elegant self-destruct program, they called in their securitypersonnel, interrogated everyone, found an informer to identify Bernay as TheMidnight Skulker, and fired him."At first the security people advised the company to hire me full-time tosearch out other flaws and discover other computer freaks.  I might have likedthat.  But I probably would have turned into a double double agent rather thanthe double agent they wanted.  I might have resurrected The Midnight Skulkerand tried to catch myself.  Who knows?  Anyway, the higher-ups turned the wholeidea down."You Can Tap the F.B.I.'s Crime Control Computer in the Comfort of Your OwnHome, PerhapsComputer freaking may be the wave of the future.  It suits the phone-phreaksensibility perfectly.  Gilbertson, the blue-box inventor and a lifelong phonephreak, has also gone on from phone-phreaking to computer-freaking.  Before hegot into the blue-box business Gilbertson, who is a highly skilled programmer,devised programs for international currency arbitrage.But he began playing with computers in earnest when he learned he could use hisblue box in tandem with the computer terminal installed in his apartment by theinstrumentation firm he worked for.  The print-out terminal and keyboard wasequipped with acoustical coupling, so that by coupling his little ivoryPrincess phone to the terminal and then coupling his blue box on that, he couldM-F his way into other computers with complete anonymity, and without charge;program and re-program them at will; feed them false or misleading information;tap and steal from them.  He explained to me that he taps computers by busyingout all the lines, then going into a verification trunk, listening into thepasswords and instructions one of the time sharers uses, and them M-F-ing inand imitating them.  He believes it would not be impossible to creep into theF.B.I's crime control computer through a local police computer terminal andphreak around with the F.B.I.'s memory banks.  He claims he has succeeded inre-programming a certain huge institutional computer in such a way that it hascordoned off an entire section of its circuitry for his personal use, and atthe same time conceals that arrangement from anyone else's notice.  I have beenunable to verify this claim.Like Captain Crunch, like Alexander Graham Bell (pseudonym of adisgruntled-looking East Coast engineer who claims to have invented the blackbox and now sells black and blue boxes to gamblers and radical heavies), likemost phone phreaks, Gilbertson began his career trying to rip off pay phones asa teenager.  Figure them out, then rip them off.  Getting his dime back fromthe pay phone is the phone phreak's first thrilling rite of passage.  Afterlearning the usual eighteen different ways of getting his dime back, Gilbertsonlearned how to make master keys to coin-phone cash boxes, and get everyoneelse's dimes back.  He stole some phone-company equipment and put together hisown home switchboard with it.  He learned to make a simple "bread-box" device,of the kind used by bookies in the Thirties (bookie gives a number to hisbetting clients; the phone with that number is installed in some widow lady'sapartment, but is rigged to ring in the bookie's shop across town, cops tracebig betting number and find nothing but the widow).Not long after that afternoon in 1968 when, deep in the stacks of anengineering library, he came across a technical journal with the phone tonefrequencies and rushed off to make his first blue box, not long after that                                    Page 55                        The Official Phreaker's ManualGilbertson abandoned a very promising career in physical chemistry and beganselling blue boxes for $1,500 apiece."I had to leave physical chemistry.  I just ran out of interesting things tolearn," he told me one evening.  We had been talking in the apartment of theman who served as the link between Gilbertson and the syndicate in arrangingthe big $300,000 blue-box deal which fell through because of legal trouble.There has been some smoking."No more interesting things to learn," he continues.  "Physical chemistry turnsout to be a sick subject when you take it to its highest level.  I don't know.I don't think I could explain to you how it's sick.  You have to be there.  Butyou get, I don't know, a false feeling of omnipotence.  I suppose it's likephone-phreaking that way.  This huge thing is there.  This whole system.  Andthere are holes in it and you slip into them like Alice and you're pretendingyou're doing something you're actually not, or at least it's no longer youthat's doing what you thought you were doing.  It's all Lewis Carroll.Physical chemistry and phone-phreaking.  That's why you have these phone-phreakpseudonyms like The Cheshire Cat, the Red King, and The Snark.  But there'ssomething about phone-phreaking that you don't find in physical chemistry."  Helooks up at me:"Did you ever steal anything?""Then you know!  You know the rush you get.  It's not just knowledge, likephysical chemistry.  It's forbidden knowledge.  You know.  You can learn aboutanything under the sun and be bored to death with it. But the idea that it'sillegal.  Look: you can be small and mobile and smart and you're ripping offsomebody large and powerful and very dangerous."People like Gilbertson and Alexander Graham Bell are always talking aboutripping off the phone company and screwing Ma Bell.  But if they were shown asingle button and told that by pushing it they could turn the entire circuitryof A.T.&T. into molten puddles, they probably wouldn't push it.  Thedisgruntled-inventor phone phreak needs the phone system the way the lapsedCatholic needs the Church, the way Satan needs a God, the way The MidnightSkulker needed, more than anything else, response.Later that evening Gilbertson finished telling me how delighted he was at theflood of blue boxes spreading throughout the country, how delighted he was toknow that "this time they're really screwed."  He suddenly shifted gears."Of course.  I do have this love/hate thing about Ma Bell.  In a way I almostlike the phone company.  I guess I'd be very sad if they were to disintegrate.In a way it's just that after having been so good they turn out to have thesethings wrong with them.  It's those flaws that allow me to get in and mess withthem, but I don't know.  There's something about it that gets to you and makesyou want to get to it, you know."I ask him what happens when he runs out of interesting, forbidden things tolearn about the phone system."I don't know, maybe I'd go to work for them for a while.""In security even?"                                    Page 56                        The Official Phreaker's Manual"I'd do it, sure.  I just as soon play -- I'd just as soon work on eitherside.""Even figuring out how to trap phone phreaks? I said, recalling Mark Bernay'sgame.""Yes, that might be interesting.  Yes, I could figure out how to outwit thephone phreaks.  Of course if I got too good at it, it might become boringagain.  Then I'd have to hope the phone phreaks got much better and outsmartedme for a while.  That would move the quality of the game up one level.  I mighteven have to help them out, you know, 'Well, kids, I wouldn't want this to getaround but did you ever think of -- ?' I could keep it going at higher andhigher levels forever."The dealer speaks up for the first time.  He has been staring at the softblinking patterns of light and colors on the translucent tiled wall facing him.(Actually there are no patterns: the color and illumination of every tile isdetermined by a computerized random-number generator designed by Gilbertsonwhich insures that there can be no meaning to any sequence of events in thetiles.)"Those are nice games you're talking about," says the dealer to his friend."But I wouldn't mind seeing them screwed.  A telephone isn't private anymore.You can't say anything you really want to say on a telephone or you have to gothrough that paranoid bullshit.  'Is it cool to talk on the phone?' I mean,even if it is cool, if you have to ask 'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool.  Youknow.  'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool.  You know.  Like those blind kids,people are going to start putting together their own private telephonecompanies if they want to really talk.  And you know what else.  You don't hearsilences on the phone anymore.  They've got this time-sharing thing onlong-distance lines where you make a pause and they snip out that piece of timeand use it to carry part of somebody else's conversation.  Instead of a pause,where somebody's maybe breathing or sighing, you get this blank hole and youonly start hearing again when someone says a word and even the beginning of theword is clipped off. Silences don't count -- you're paying for them, but theytake them away from you.  It's not cool to talk and you can't hear someone whenthey don't talk.  What the hell good is the phone?  I wouldn't mind seeing themtotally screwed."+-- End third file of four --+                                    Page 57                        The Official Phreaker's Manual         ***** The AAG Proudly Presents The AAG Proudly Presents *****         *                                                           *         *      +----------------------------------------------+     *         *                                                           *         *              Secrets of the Little Blue Box               *         *                                                           *         *                     by Ron Rosenbaum                      *         *                 Typed by One Farad Cap/AAG                *         *                                                           *         *        -A story so incredible it may even make you        *         *             feel sorry for the phone company-             *         *                                                           *         *                  (Fourth of four files)                   *         *                                                           *         *      +----------------------------------------------+     *         *                                                           *         ***** The AAG Proudly Presents The AAG Proudly Presents *****The Big Memphis BustJoe Engressia never wanted to screw Ma Bell.  His dream had always been to workfor her.The day I visited Joe in his small apartment on Union Avenue in Memphis, he wasupset about another setback in his application for a telephone job."They're stalling on it.  I got a letter today telling me they'd have topostpone the interview I requested again.  My landlord read it for me.  Theygave me some runaround about wanting papers on my rehabilitation status but Ithink there's something else going on."When I switched on the 40-watt bulb in Joe's room -- he sometimes forgets whenhe has guests -- it looked as if there was enough telephone hardware to start asmall phone company of his own.There is one phone on top of his desk, one phone sitting in an open drawerbeneath the desk top.  Next to the desk-top phone is a cigar-box-size M-Fdevice with big toggle switches, and next to that is some kind of switching andcoupling device with jacks and alligator plugs hanging loose.  Next to that isa Braille typewriter.  On the floor next to the desk, lying upside down like adead tortoise, is the half-gutted body of an old black standard phone.  Acrossthe room on a torn and dusty couch are two more phones, one of them atouch-tone model; two tape recorders; a heap of phone patches and cassettes,and a life-size toy telephone.Our conversation is interrupted every ten minutes by phone phreaks from allover the country ringing Joe on just about every piece of equipment but the toyphone and the Braille typewriter.  One fourteen-year-old blind kid fromConnecticut calls up and tells Joe he's got a girl friend.  He wants to talk toJoe about girl friends. Joe says they'll talk later in the evening when theycan be alone on the line.  Joe draws a deep breath, whistles him off the airwith an earsplitting 2600-cycle whistle. Joe is pleased to get the calls but helooked worried and preoccupied that evening, his brow constantly furrowed overhis dark wandering eyes.  In addition to the phone-company stall, he has justlearned that his apartment house is due to be demolished in sixty days forurban renewal.  For all its shabbiness, the Union Avenue apartment house hasbeen Joe's first home-of-his-own and he's worried that he may not find anotherbefore this one is demolished.                                    Page 58                        The Official Phreaker's ManualBut what really bothers Joe is that switchmen haven't been listening to him."I've been doing some checking on 800 numbers lately, and I've discovered thatcertain 800 numbers in New Hampshire couldn't be reached from Missouri andKansas.  Now it may sound like a small thing, but I don't like to see sloppywork; it makes me feel bad about the lines.  So I've been calling up switchingoffices and reporting it, but they haven't corrected it.  I called them up forthe third time today and instead of checking they just got mad.  Well, thatgets me mad.  I mean, I do try to help them.  There's something about them Ican't understand -- you want to help them and they just try to say you'redefrauding them."It is Sunday evening and Joe invites me to join him for dinner at a HolidayInn.  Frequently on Sunday evening Joe takes some of his welfare money, calls acab, and treats himself to a steak dinner at one of Memphis' thirteen HolidayInns.  (Memphis is the headquarters of Holiday Inn.  Holiday Inns have been afavorite for Joe ever since he made his first solo phone trip to a Bellswitching office in Jacksonville, Florida, and stayed in the Holiday Inn there.He likes to stay at Holiday Inns, he explains, because they represent freedomto him and because the rooms are arranged the same all over the country so heknows that any Holiday Inn room is familiar territory to him.  Just like anytelephone.)Over steaks in the Pinnacle Restaurant of the Holiday Inn Medical Center onMadison Avenue in Memphis, Joe tells me the highlights of his life as a phonephreak.At age seven, Joe learned his first phone trick.  A mean baby-sitter, tired oflistening to little Joe play with the phone as he always did, constantly, put alock on the phone dial.  "I got so mad.  When there's a phone sitting there andI can't use it... so I started getting mad and banging the receiver up anddown.  I noticed I banged it once and it dialed one.  Well, then I triedbanging it twice...." In a few minutes Joe learned how to dial by pressing thehook switch at the right time.  "I was so excited I remember going 'whoo whoo'and beat a box down on the floor."At age eight Joe learned about whistling.  "I was listening to some interceptnon working-number recording in L.A.- I was calling L.A. as far back as that,but I'd mainly dial non working numbers because there was no charge, and I'dlisten to these recordings all day.  Well, I was whistling 'cause listening tothese recordings can be boring after a while even if they are from L.A., andall of a sudden, in the middle of whistling, the recording clicked off.  Ifiddled around whistling some more, and the same thing happened.  So I calledup the switch room and said, 'I'm Joe.  I'm eight years old and I want to knowwhy when I whistle this tune the line clicks off.'  He tried to explain it tome, but it was a little too technical at the time.  I went on learning.  Thatwas a thing nobody was going to stop me from doing. The phones were my life,and I was going to pay any price to keep on learning.  I knew I could go tojail.  But I had to do what I had to do to keep on learning."The phone is ringing when we walk back into Joe's apartment on Union Avenue.It is Captain Crunch.  The Captain has been following me around by phone,calling up everywhere I go with additional bits of advice and explanation forme and whatever phone phreak I happen to be visiting.  This time the Captainreports he is calling from what he describes as "my hideaway high up in theSierra Nevada."  He pulses out lusty salvos of M-F and tells Joe he is about to"go out and get a little action tonight.  Do some phreaking of another kind, ifyou know what I mean."  Joe chuckles.                                    Page 59                        The Official Phreaker's ManualThe Captain then tells me to make sure I understand that what he told me abouttying up the nation's phone lines was true, but that he and the phone phreakshe knew never used the technique for sabotage.  They only learned the techniqueto help the phone company."We do a lot of troubleshooting for them.  Like this New Hampshire/MissouriWATS-line flaw I've been screaming about.  We help them more than they know."After we say good-bye to the Captain and Joe whistles him off the line, Joetells me about a disturbing dream he had the night before: "I had been caughtand they were taking me to a prison.  It was a long trip.  They were taking meto a prison a long long way away.  And we stopped at a Holiday Inn and it wasmy last night ever using the phone and I was crying and crying, and the lady atthe Holiday Inn said, 'Gosh, honey, you should never be sad at a Holiday Inn.You should always be happy here.  Especially since it's your last night.'  Andthat just made it worse and I was sobbing so much I couldn't stand it."Two weeks after I left Joe Engressia's apartment, phone-company security agentsand Memphis police broke into it.  Armed with a warrant, which they left pinnedto a wall, they confiscated every piece of equipment in the room, including histoy telephone.  Joe was placed under arrest and taken to the city jail where hewas forced to spend the night since he had no money and knew no one in Memphisto call.It is not clear who told Joe what that night, but someone told him that thephone company had an open-and-shut case against him because of revelations ofillegal activity he had made to a phone-company undercover agent.By morning Joe had become convinced that the reporter from Esquire, with whomhe had spoken two weeks ago, was the undercover agent.  He probably had uglythoughts about someone he couldn't see gaining his confidence, listening to himtalk about his personal obsessions and dreams, while planning all the while tolock him up."I really thought he was a reporter," Engressia told the Memphis Press-Seminar."I told him everything...." Feeling betrayed, Joe proceeded to confesseverything to the press and police.As it turns out, the phone company did use an undercover agent to trap Joe,although it was not the Esquire reporter.Ironically, security agents were alerted and began to compile a case againstJoe because of one of his acts of love for the system: Joe had called aninternal service department to report that he had located a group of defectivelong-distance trunks, and to complain again about the New Hampshire/MissouriWATS problem.  Joe always liked Ma Bell's lines to be clean and responsive.  Asuspicious switchman reported Joe to the security agents who discovered thatJoe had never had a long-distance call charged to his name.Then the security agents learned that Joe was planning one of his phone tripsto a local switching office.  The security people planted one of their agentsin the switching office.  He posed as a student switchman and followed Joearound on a tour.  He was extremely friendly and helpful to Joe, leading himaround the office by the arm. When the tour was over he offered Joe a ride backto his apartment house.  On the way he asked Joe -- one tech man to another --about "those blue boxers" he'd heard about.  Joe talked about them freely,talked about his blue box freely, and about all the other things he could do                                    Page 60                        The Official Phreaker's Manualwith the phones.The next day the phone-company security agents slapped a monitoring tape onJoe's line, which eventually picked up an illegal call.  Then they applied forthe search warrant and broke in.In court Joe pleaded not guilty to possession of a blue box and theft ofservice.  A sympathetic judge reduced the charges to malicious mischief andfound him guilty on that count, sentenced him to two thirty-day sentences to beserved concurrently and then suspended the sentence on condition that Joepromise never to play with phones again.  Joe promised, but the phone companyrefused to restore his service.  For two weeks after the trial Joe could not bereached except through the pay phone at his apartment house, and the landlordscreened all calls for him.Phone-phreak Carl managed to get through to Joe after the trial, and reportedthat Joe sounded crushed by the whole affair."What I'm worried about," Carl told me, "is that Joe means it this time.  Thepromise.  That he'll never phone-phreak again.  That's what he told me, thathe's given up phone-phreaking for good.  I mean his entire life.  He says heknows they're going to be watching him so closely for the rest of his lifehe'll never be able to make a move without going straight to jail.  He soundedvery broken up by the whole experience of being in jail. It was awful to hearhim talk that way.  I don't know.  I hope maybe he had to sound that way.  Overthe phone, you know."He reports that the entire phone-phreak underground is up in arms over thephone company's treatment of Joe.  "All the while Joe had his hopes pinned onhis application for a phone-company job, they were stringing him along gettingready to bust him.  That gets me mad.  Joe spent most of his time helping themout.  The bastards.  They think they can use him as an example.  All of suddenthey're harassing us on the coast.  Agents are jumping up on our lines.  Theyjust busted ------'s mute yesterday and ripped out his lines.  But no matterwhat Joe does, I don't think we're going to take this lying down."Two weeks later my phone rings and about eight phone phreaks in succession sayhello from about eight different places in the country, among them Carl, Ed,and Captain Crunch.  A nationwide phone-phreak conference line has beenreestablished through a switching machine in --------, with the cooperation ofa disgruntled switchman."We have a special guest with us today," Carl tells me.The next voice I hear is Joe's.  He reports happily that he has just moved to aplace called Millington, Tennessee, fifteen miles outside of Memphis, where hehas been hired as a telephone-set repairman by a small independent phonecompany.  Someday he hopes to be an equipment troubleshooter."It's the kind of job I dreamed about.  They found out about me from thepublicity surrounding the trial.  Maybe Ma Bell did me a favor busting me.I'll have telephones in my hands all day long.""You know the expression, 'Don't get mad, get even'?" phone-phreak Carl askedme.  "Well, I think they're going to be very sorry about what they did to Joeand what they're trying to do to us."+-- End fourth file of four --+                                    Page 61                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                    $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$                    $                                     $                    $         THE HISTORY OF ESS          $                    $         --- ------- -- ---          $                    $                                     $                    $                                     $                    $      Another original phile by:     $                    $                                     $                    $                                     $                    $$$$$$$$$$$$-=>Lex Luthor<=-$$$$$$$$$$$                    $                                     $                    $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$   Of all the new 1960s wonders of telephone technology - satellites, ultramodern Traffic Service Positions (TSPS) for operators, the picturephone, and soon - the one that gave Bell Labs the most trouble, and unexpectedly became thegreatest development effort in Bell System's history, was the perfection of anelectronic switching system, or ESS.   It may be recalled that such a system was the specific end in view when theproject that had culminated in the invention of the transistor had beenlaunched back in the 1930s. After successful accomplishment of that plannedmiracle in 1947-48, further delays were brought about by financial stringencyand the need for further development of the transistor itself.  In the early1950s, a Labs team began serious work on electronic switching.  As early as1955, Western Electric became involved when five engineers from the Hawthorneworks were assigned to collaborate with the Labs on the project. The presidentof AT&T in 1956, wrote confidently, "At Bell Labs, development of the newelectronic switching system is going full speed ahead. We are sure this willlead to many improvements in service and also to greater efficiency. The firstservice trial will start in Morris, Ill., in 1959." Shortly thereafter, Kappelsaid that the cost of the whole project would probably be $45 million.   But it gradually became apparent that the development of a commerciallyusable electronic switching system -in effect, a computerized telephoneexchange - presented vastly greater technical problems than had beenanticipated, and that, accordingly, Bell Labs had vastly underestimated boththe time and the investment needed to do the job. The year 1959 passed withoutthe promised first trial at Morris, Illinois; it was finally made in November1960, and quickly showed how much more work remained to be done.  As timedragged on and costs mounted, there was a concern at AT&T and some-thingapproaching panic at Bell Labs.  But the project had to go forward; by thistime the investment was too great to be sacrificed, and in any case, forwardprojections of increased demand for telephone service indicated that within aphew years a time would come when, without the quantum leap in speed andflexibility that electronic switching would provide, the national network wouldbe unable to meet the demand. In November 1963, an all-electronic switchingsystem went into use at the Brown Engineering Company at Cocoa Beach, Florida.But this was a small installation, essentially another test installation,serving only a single company. Kappel's tone on the subject in the 1964 annualreport was, for him, an almost apologetic: "Electronic switching equipment mustbe manufactured in volume to unprecedented standards of reliability.... To turnout the equipment economically and with good speed, mass production methodsmust be developed; but, at the same time, there can be no loss of precision..."Another year and millions of dollars later, on May 30, 1965, the firstcommercial electric central office was put into service at Succasunna, NewJersey.                                    Page 62                        The Official Phreaker's Manual   Even at Succasunna, only 200 of the town's 4,300 subscribers initially hadthe benefit of electronic switching's added speed and additional services, suchas provision for three party conversations and automatic transfer of incomingcalls. But after that, ESS was on its way. In January 1966, the secondcommercial installation, this one serving 2,900 telephones, went into servicein Chase, Maryland. By the end of 1967 there were additional ESS offices inCalifornia, Connecticut, Minnesota, Georgia, New York, Florida, andPennsylvania; by the end of 1970 there were 120 offices serving 1.8 millioncustomers; and by 1974 there were 475 offices serving 5.6 million customers.   The difference between conventional switching and electronic switching isthe difference between "hardware" and "software"; in the former case,maintenance is done on the spot, with screwdriver and pliers, while in the caseof electronic switching, it can be done remotely, by computer, from a centralpoint, making it possible to have only one or two technicians on duty at a timeat each switching center.   The development program, when the final figures were added up, was found tohave required a staggering four thousand man-years of work at Bell Labs and tohave cost not $45 million but $500 million!                                    Page 63                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                    $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$                    $                                     $                    $   THE HISTORY OF BRITISH PHREAKING  $                    $   -=- -=-=-=- -- -=-=-=- -=-=-=-=-  $                    $                                     $                    $     THE SECOND IN A SERIES OF       $                    $     THE HISTORY OF.....PHILES       $                    $                                     $                    $       WRITTEN AND UPLOADED BY:      $                    $                                     $                    $$$$$$$$$$$$-=>LEX LUTHOR<=-$$$$$$$$$$$                    $                 AND                 $                    $          THE LEGION OF DOOM!        $                    $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  NOTE:  THE BRITISH POST OFFICE, IS THE U.S.  EQUIVALENT OF MA BELL.  IN BRITAIN, PHREAKING GOES BACK TO THE EARLY FIFTIES, WHEN THE TECHNIQUE OF'TOLL A DROP BACK' WAS DISCOVERED.  TOLL A WAS AN EXCHANGE NEAR ST.  PAULSWHICH ROUTED CALLS BETWEEN LONDON AND NEARBY NON-LONDON EXCHANGES.  THE TRICKWAS TO DIAL AN UNALLOCATED NUMBER, AND THEN DEPRESS THE RECEIVER-REST FOR 1/2SECOND.  THIS FLASHING INITIATED THE 'CLEAR FORWARD' SIGNAL, LEAVING THE CALLERWITH AN OPEN LINE INTO THE TOLL A EXCHANGE.THE COULD THEN DIAL 018, WHICHFORWARDED HIM TO THE TRUNK EXCHANGE AT THAT TIME, THE FIRST LONG DISTANCEEXCHANGE IN BRITAIN AND FOLLOW IT WITH THE CODE FOR THE DISTANT EXCHANGE TOWHICH HE WOULD BE CONNECTED AT NO EXTRA CHARGE.  THE SIGNALS NEEDED TO CONTROL THE UK NETWORK TODAY WERE PUBLISHED IN THE"INSTITUTION OF POST OFFICE ENGINEERS JOURNAL" AND REPRINTED IN THE SUNDAYTIMES (15 OCT.  1972).  THE SIGNALLING SYSTEM THEY USE:  SIGNALLING SYSTEM NO.  3 USES PAIRS OFFREQUENCIES SELECTED FROM 6 TONES SEPARATED BY 120HZ.  WITH THAT INFO, THEPHREAKS MADE "BLEEPERS" OR AS THEY ARE CALLED HERE IN THE U.S.  "BLUE BOX", BUTTHEY DO UTILIZE DIFFERENT MF TONES THEN THE U.S., THUS, YOUR U.S.  BLUE BOXTHAT YOU SMUGGLED INTO THE UK WILL NOT WORK, UNLESS YOU CHANGE THEFREQUENCIES.  IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES, A SIMPLER SYSTEM BASED ON DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PULSESWITH THE SAME FREQUENCY (2280HZ) WAS USED.  FOR MORE INFO ON THAT, TRY TO GET AHOLD OF:  ATKINSON'S "TELEPHONY AND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY".  IN THE EARLY DAYS OF BRITISH PHREAKING, THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY TITANCOMPUTER WAS USED TO RECORD AND CIRCULATE NUMBERS FOUND BY THE EXHAUSTIVEDIALING OF LOCAL NETWORKS.  THESE NUMBERS WERE USED TO CREATE A CHAIN OF LINKSFROM LOCAL EXCHANGE TO LOCAL EXCHANGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BYPASSING THE TRUNKCIRCUITS.  BECAUSE THE INTERNAL ROUTING CODES IN THE UK NETWORK ARE NOT THESAME AS THOSE DIALED BY THE CALLER, THE PHREAKS HAD TO DISCOVER THEM BY 'PROBEAND LISTEN' TECHNIQUES OR MORE COMMONLY KNOWN IN THE U.S.-- SCANNING.  WHATTHEY DID WAS PUT IN LIKELY SIGNALS AND LISTENED TO FIND OUT IF THEY SUCCEEDED.THE RESULTS OF SCANNING WERE CIRCULATED TO OTHER PHREAKS. DISCOVERING EACHOTHER TOOK TIME AT FIRST, BUT EVENTUALLY THE PHREAKS BECAME ORGANIZED.  THE"TAP" OF BRITAIN WAS CALLED "UNDERCURRENTS" WHICH ENABLED BRITISH PHREAKS TOSHARE THE INFO ON NEW NUMBERS, EQUIPMENT ETC.  TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BRITISH BRITISH PHREAKS DID, THINK OF THE PHONENETWORK IN THREE LAYERS OF LINES:  LOCAL, TRUNK, AND INTERNATIONAL.#IN THE UK,SUBSCRIBER TRUNK DIALING (STD), IS THE MECHANISM WHICH TAKES A CALL FROM THE                                    Page 64                        The Official Phreaker's ManualLOCAL LINES AND (LEGITIMATELY) ELEVATES IT TO A TRUNK OR INTERNATIONALLEVEL.#THE UK PHREAKS FIGURED THAT A CALL AT TRUNK LEVEL CAN BE ROUTED THROUGHANY NUMBER OF EXCHANGES, PROVIDED THAT THE RIGHT ROUTING CODES WERE FOUND ANDUSED CORRECTLY.  THEY ALSO HAD TO DISCOVER HOW TO GET FROM LOCAL TO TRUNK LEVELEITHER WITHOUT BEING CHARGED (WHICH THEY DID WITH A BLEEPER BOX) OR WITHOUTUSING (STD).  CHAINING HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED BUT IT REQUIRES LONG STRINGSOF DIGITS AND SPEECH GETS MORE AND MORE FAINT AS THE CHAIN GROWS, JUST LIKE ITDOES WHEN YOU STACK TRUNKS BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE U.S.#THE WAY THE SECURITYREPS SNAGGED THE PHREAKS WAS TO PUT A SIMPLE 'PRINTERMETER' OR AS WE CALL IT:A PEN REGISTER ON THE SUSPECTS LINE, WHICH SHOWS EVERY DIGIT DIALED FROM THESUBSCRIBERS LINE.  THE BRITISH PREFER TO GET ONTO THE TRUNKS RATHER THAN CHAINING.  ONE WAY WASTO DISCOVER WHERE LOCAL CALLS USE THE TRUNKS BETWEEN NEIGHBORING EXCHANGES,START A CALL AND STAY ON THE TRUNK INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO THE LOCAL LEVEL ONREACHING THE DISTANT SWITCH.  THIS AGAIN REQUIRED EXHAUSTIVE DIALING AND MADEMORE WORK FOR TITAN; IT ALSO REVEALED 'FIDDLES', WHICH WERE INSERTED BY POSTOFFICE ENGINEERS.  WHAT FIDDLING MEANS IS THAT THE ENGINEERS REWIRED THE EXCHANGES FOR THEIR OWNBENEFIT.  THE EQUIPMENT IS MODIFIED TO GIVE ACCESS TO A TRUNK WITH OUT BEINGCHARGED, AN OPERATION WHICH IS PRETTY EASY IN STEP BY STEP (SXS)ELECTROMECHANICAL EXCHANGES, WHICH WERE INSTALLED IN BRITAIN EVEN IN THE 1970S(NOTE:  I KNOW OF A BACK DOOR INTO THE CANADIAN SYSTEM ON A 4A CO., SO IF YOUARE ON SXS OR A 4A, TRY SCANNING 3 DIGIT EXCHANGES, IE:  DIAL 999,998,997ETC.#AND LISTEN FOR THE BEEP-KERCHINK, IF THERE ARE NO 3 DIGIT CODES WHICHALLOW DIRECT ACCESS TO A TANDEM IN YOUR LOCAL EXCHANGE AND BYPASSES THE AMA SOYOU WON'T BE BILLED, NOT HAVE TO BLAST 2600 EVERY TIME YOU WISH TO BOX A CALL.  A FAMOUS BRITISH 'FIDDLER' REVEALED IN THE EARLY 1970S WORKED BY DIALING 173.THE CALLER THEN ADDED THE TRUNK CODE OF 1 AND THE SUBSCRIBERS LOCAL NUMBER.  ATTHAT TIME, MOST ENGINEERING TEST SERVICES BEGAN WITH 17X, SO THE ENGINEERSCOULD HIDE THEIR FIDDLES IN THE NEST OF SERVICE WIRES.  WHEN SECURITY REPSSTARTED SEARCHING, THE FIDDLES WERE CONCEALED BY TONES SIGNALLING:  'NUMBERUNOBTAINALBE' OR 'EQUIPMENT ENGAGED' WHICH SWITCHED OFF AFTER A DELAY.  THENECESSARY RELAYS ARE SMALL AND EASILY HIDDEN.  THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO PHREAKING IN THE UK IN THE SIXTIES. BEFORE STD WASWIDESPREAD, MANY 'ORDINARY' PEOPLE WERE DRIVEN TO.OCCASIONAL PHREAKING FROM SHEER FRUSTRATION AT THE INEFFICIENT OPERATORCONTROLLED TRUNK SYSTEM.  THIS CAME TO A HEAD DURING A STRIKE ABOUT 1961 WHENOPERATORS COULD NOT BE REACHED.  NOTHING COMPLICATED WAS NEEDED.  MANYOPERATORS HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF REPEATING THE CODES AS THEY DIALLED THEREQUESTED NUMBERS SO PEOPLE SOON LEARNT THE NUMBERS THEY CALLED FREQUENTLY.THE ONLY 'TRICK' WAS TO KNOW WHICH EXCHANGES COULD BE DIALLED THROUGH TO PASSON THE TRUNK NUMBER.CALLERS ALSO NEEDED A PRETTY QUIET PLACE TO DO IT, SINCETIMING RELATIVE TO CLICKS WAS IMPORTANT THE MOST FAMOUS TRIAL OF BRITISHPHREAKS WAS CALLED THE OLD BAILY TRIAL.#WHICH STARTED ON 3 OCT.  1973.#WHATTHEY PHREAKS DID WAS TO DIAL A SPARE NUMBER AT A LOCAL CALL RATE BUT INVOLVINGA TRUNK TO ANOTHER EXCHANGE THEN THEY SEND A 'CLEAR FORWARD' TO THEIR LOCALEXCHANGE, INDICATING TO IT THAT THE CALL IS FINISHED;BUT THE DISTANT EXCHANGEDOESN'T REALIZE BECAUSE THE CALLER'S PHONE IS STILL OFF THE HOOK.  THEY NOWHAVE AN OPEN LINE INTO THE DISTANT TRUNK EXCHANGE AND SENDS TO IT A 'SEIZE'SIGNAL:  '1' WHICH PUTS HIM ONTO ITS OUTGOING LINES NOW, IF THEY KNOW THECODES, THE WORLD IS OPEN TO THEM.  ALL OTHER EXCHANGES TRUST HIS LOCAL EXCHANGETO HANDLE THE BILLING; THEY JUST INTERPRET THE TONES THEY HEAR.  MEAN WHILE,THE LOCAL EXCHANGE COLLECTS ONLY FOR A LOCAL CALL.

He was exploring the 804 area code (Virginia) and found out thatthe 840 exchange did something strange.  In the vast majority of cases, in fact in all of the cases except one, hewould get a recording as if the exchange didn't exist. However, if he dialed804-840 and four rather predictable numbers, he got a ring!   After one or two rings, somebody picked up.  Being experienced at this kindof thing, he could tell that the call didn't "supe", that is, no charges werebeing incurred for calling this number.  (Calls that get you to an error message, or a special operator, generallydon't supervise.)  A female voice, with a hint of a Southern accent said,"Operator, can I help you?"   "Yes," he said, "What number have I reached?"   "What number did you dial, sir?"   He made up a number that was similar.   "I'm sorry that is not the number you reached."  Click.   He was fascinated.  What in the world was this?  He knew he was going tocall back, but before he did, he tried some more experiments. He tried the 840exchange in several other area codes.  In some, it came up as a valid exchange.In others, exactly the same thing happened -- the same last four digits, thesame Southern belle.  Oddly enough, he later noticed, the areas worked inseemed to travel in a beeline from Washington DC to Pittsburgh, PA.   He called back from a payphone.  "Operator, can I help you?"   "Yes, this is the phone company.  I'm testing this line and we don't seem tohave an identification on your circuit.  What office is this, please?"   "What number are you trying to reach?"   "I'm not trying to reach any number.  I'm trying to identify this circuit."   "I'm sorry, I can't help you."   "Ma'am, if I don't get an ID on this line, I'll have to disconnect it.  Weshow no record of it here."   "Hold on a moment, sir."   After about a minute, she came back.  "Sir, I can have someone speak to you.Would you give me your number, please?"   He had anticipated this and he had the payphone number ready. After he gaveit, she said, "Mr. XXX will get right back to you."   "Thanks."  He hung up the phone.  It rang.  INSTANTLY!  "Oh my God," hethought, "They weren't asking for my number -- they were confirming it!"   "Hello," he said, trying to sound authoritative.                                    Page 67                        The Official Phreaker's Manual   "This is Mr. XXX.  Did you just make  an inquiry to my office concerning aphone number?"   "Yes.  I need an identi--"   "What you need is advice.  Don't ever call that number again. Forget youever knew it."   At this point our friend got so nervous he just hung up.  He expected tohear the phone ring again but it didn't.   Over the next few days he racked his brains trying to figure out what thenumber was.  He knew it was something big -- that was pretty certain at thispoint.  It was so big that the number was programmed into every central officein the country.  He knew this because if he tried to dial any other number inthat exchange, he'd get a local error message from his CO, as if the exchangedidn't exist.   It finally came to him.  He had an uncle who worked in a federal agency.  Hehad a feeling that this was government related and if it was, his uncle couldprobably find out what it was.  He asked the next day and his uncle promised tolook into the matter.   The next time he saw his uncle, he noticed a big change in his manner.  Hewas trembling.  "Where did you get that number?!"  he shouted.  "Do you know Ialmost got fired for asking about it?!? They kept wanting to know where I gotit."   Our friend couldn't contain his excitement.  "What is it?" he pleaded."What's the number?!""IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S BOMB SHELTER!"   He never called the number after that.  He knew that he could probably causequite a bit of excitement by calling the number and saying something like, "Theweather's not good in Washington.  We're coming over for a visit."  But ourfriend was smart.  he knew that there were some things that were better offunsaid and undone. <>From @UICVM.uic.edu:TK0JUT2@NIU Tue Jun 12 06:40:26 1990                                    Page 68                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                                   Chapter 3   This chapter is really just a bunch of FACS (pun intended).  Here is whererandom facts that really have something to do with everything else but nothingto do with anything else, are presented.  They cover various topics such as:Conferencing, Tracing, Pen registers, Calling cards, and some basic FMF (Foolthe Mother Fuckers).  The aspects covered here are very brief and could easilybe covered much more thoroughly, but it is no problem since they are not veryimportant topics.  Something that would make a very nice gift is covered in thearticle AT&T forgery.  Just make up stationary with AT&T letter head and giveit as a present to your phriends who would appreciate it.                                    Page 69                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                               Phreaking COSMOS         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-    COSMOS is Bell's computer for handling information on customer lines,special services on lines, and orders to change line equipment, disconnectlines, etc.  COSMOS stands for Computerized System for Mainframe Operations. Itis based on the UNIX operating system and, depending upon the COSMOS and uponyour access, has some, many, or no UNIX standard commands.  COSMOS is powerful,but there is no reason to be afraid of it.  This article will give some of thebasic, pertinent info on how users get in, account format, and a few othergoodies.                            Password Identification         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-    To get onto COSMOS you need a dialup, account, password, and wire center(WC).  Wire centers are two letter codes that tell what section of the COSMOSyou are in.  There are different WC's f or different areas and groups ofexchanges.  Examples are PB, SR, LK, et c. Sometimes there are accounts thathave no password; obviously such accounts are the easiest to hack.                                Checking It Out         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-    Let's suppose you have a COSMOS number which you obtained one way oranother.  The first thing to do would be to make sure it is really a COSMOSsystem, not some other Bell or AT&T computer.  To do this, you would call itand connect your modem,, then hit some returns until you got a response. Itshould say: ';LOGIN:' or 'NAME:'.    If you enter some garbage it should say:'PASSWORD:'.    If you hit a return and it says 'WC?', it is a COSMOS system.  If it sayssomething like 'TA%' then you're in business.  If it doesn't do any of theabove, then it is either some other  kind of system, or, if you're not gettinganything at all, the dialup has  probably gone bad.                                  Getting In         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-    COSMOS has certain accounts that are  usually on the system, one of whichmight not have a password.  They consist of ROOT (most powerful and almostalways on the system), SYS (second most  powerful, still many privileges), BIN(a little less power), PREOP (a little less), and COSMOS (hardly anyprivileges, like a normal user).  The way to tell if they have passwords is byentering accounts at the ';LOGIN:' or ' NAME:' prompt, and if it jumps straightto 'WC?', all you need is a WC to get in.  But suppose all of the accounts havepasswords?  You have two choices. You  can try to hack the password and WC toone of the above accounts.  I won't deal with this method, as isself-explanatory.  Or you can do something I  find much easier...call theCOSMOS during business hours and hope that someone forgot to log off. Keepcalling until when you connect and hit return until you get a 'WC%' prompt.'WC' is the WC that the account you found is currently in. You are now in!                           What to Do while on-line         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-                                    Page 70                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    The first thing you want to do is write down the WC you are in. Only on ourfirst login it is a good idea to print everything or dump everything to abuffer.                                   Commands         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-'WCFLDS'(!)     : Should list all WC's.'WHO'           : Should print everyone currently logged on the system, givingsome accounts.'TTY'           : Tells what terminal port you are on.'WHERE'         : Should tell the location of the COSMOS installation.'WHAT'          : Tells what version of COSNIX, COSMOS's operating system, itis.'LS *'          : Prints all the files you  have access to.'CD /dir'       : Connects you to the directory '/dir'.'CAT filename ' : Prints the file 'filename'.'Q'             : Quits the editor.CTRL- Y.        : Logs off'TAT'           : Sometimes prints a little help file.'ISH'           : Check someone's telefone #, type 'ISH' at the COSMOS 'WC%'prompt. Then type.'HTN XXX-XXXX'  : (Hunt Telephone Number) to tell you about the local numberyou are interested in.'CAT /ETC/PASSWD': Prints out the password file, if you have access. Thepasswords are almost always encrypted, but you get a  list of all the accounts.If you are lucky, one of the lines will have two colons after the account name.This means there is no prompt from the ';LOGIN:' or 'NAME:' prompts when youenter that account.To run a file just type the name followed by a return.   When the system gives you a '-', you type a '.', and it will type all kindsof info on the phone number you entered (in Bell abbreviations, of course).  Ifit is not a good exchange, it will say something to that effect.  You type aperiod to end the ISH.   If you wish to learn more information about COSMOS, find yourself a COSMOSmanual or look at future issues of 2600.  A UNIX manual would also be helpfulfor standard UNIX commands.                                    Page 71                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                                  FACS  FACTS                        A LOOK AT THE NEW FACS SYSTEMS                                BY SHARP RAZOR    BELL ATLANTIC (AND PROBABLY THE REST OF THE U.S. SOON ENOUGH) IS REVAMPINGCOSMOS.

THE PREMIS AND THE COSMOS SYSTEMS CAN FUNCTION AS ST AND-ALONESYSTEMS.THE FIVE PARTS OF FACS ARE PREMIS,SOAC, LFACS,COSMOS,AND THE WM.    THE PREMIS (PREMISES INFORMATION SYSTEM) SUPPORTS BOTH RESIDENCE ANDBUSINESS ACCOUNTS. PREMIS IS USED FOR VARIOUS INQUIRIES FOR THE STREET ADDRESSGUIDE(SAG),IE::PHONE NUMBERS,BILLING CHARGES,CREDIT,ETC.    THE SECOND PART OF FACS IS THE SOAC(SERVICE ORDER ANALYSIS AND CONTROL).THIS IS PRIMARILY USED TO INPUT SERVICE ORDER DATA INTO FACS, AND TO GET THEAPPROPRIATE OUTPUT.  SOAC INTERPRETS, VALIDATES,AND DECOMPOSES ALL INPUTED DATAAND SENDS THE INFO TO THE COSMOS AND THE LFACS SYSTEMS.    THE THIRD PART OF THE SYSTEM IS LFACS(LOOP FACILITIES AND CONTROL SYSTEM).THIS IS THE COMPONENT OF FACS THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THEINVENTORY,DOING THE ASSIGNMENTS, ADMINISTRATING INQUIRIES AND REPORTS, AND ISTHE INVENTORY TRANSFORMATION CENTER. THIS PART OF FACS WILL BE MOSTLY USED FORAIDING THE AT&T LINEMEN.    THE COSMOS SYSTEM(COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR MAINFRAME OPERATIONS) COMPRISES THEFOURTH PART OF THE FACS SYSTEM. COSMOS IS THE COMPONENT OF FACS THAT ISRESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE MECHANIZED INVENTORY OF MDF FACILITIES,STORINGCUSTOM CALL FEATURES(IE:SPEED DIALING NUMBERS),AND OTHER MISC.

IT ENABLES A NUMBER OFCOSMOS COMPUTERS TO RELIABLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE OTHER FACS COMPONENTS.  WMSERVES AS THE MESSAGES SWITCHING SYSTEM FOR THE FACS PIECES, AND GENERALLY ISTHE "MESSENGER AND STABILIZER" OF THE SYSTEM.        THE HARDWARE THAT WILL RUN THIS FACS SYSTEM IS:   COSMOS:  22-WECO. 3B-20S MINI COMPS.   WM:      6-WECO.  3B-20S MINI COMPS.   SOAC-LFACS-PREMIS: TWO SPERRY UNIVAC 1100/92 MAINFRAMES.                      BANCS 2 THP CYBER 1000 PROCESSORS.     THE FACS SYSTEM IS STARTING UP AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

No, I don't mean 80 nodes, but 80 networks withthousands of unprotected computers. When you call your local Telenet- gateway,you can only call those computers which accept reverse-charging- calls.  If you want to call computers in foreign countries or computers in USA whichdo not accept R-calls, you need a Telenet-ID. Did you ever notice that you cantype ID XXXX when being connected to Telenet? You are then asked for thepassword. If you have such a NUI (Network-User-ID) you can call nearly everyhost connected to any computer-network in the world.

Okto place a call with an AT&T card, lift the handset (PAY PHONE) hit (0) and thedesired area code and the  number to call. Also when calling the same numberthat the card is being billed to you enter the phone number and at  the toneonly enter the last four digits on the card. But we don't want  to do that now,do we. If additional calls are wanted all you do is hit the (#) and you willget a new dial tone! After you hit (#) you do not have to  re-enter the callingcard number  simply enter your desired number and it will connect you.    If the number you called is busy just keep hitting (#) and the number to becalled until you connect! Ok to calL the U.S. of a from another country, youuse the exact same format as described above!    Ok now I will describe the procedure for placing calls to a foreigncountry, such as CANADA,RUSSIA,SOUTH AMERICA, etc.. Ok first lift the handsetthen enter (01) + the country code + the city code + the local telephonenumber. Ok after you get the tone enter the AT&T calling card number. Ok if youcan not dial operator assisted calls from your area don't worry just jingle theoperator and she will handle your call, don't worry she can't see you!    The international number on the AT&T calling card is used for calling theUS of A from places like RUSSIA, CHINA you never know when you might get stuckin a country like those and you have no money to make a call! The internationaloperator will be able to tell you if they honor the AT&T calling card.    Well I hope that this has straightened out some of your problems on the useof an AT&T calling card! All you have to remember is that weather you areplacing the call or the operator, be careful and never use the calling cardfrom your home phone!! That is a BIG NO NO..    Also AT&T has came out with a new thing called (NEW CARD CALLER SERVICE)they say that it was designed to meet the public's needs! These phones will bepopping up in many place such as airport terminals, hotels, etc... What the newcard caller service is, is a new type of phone that has a  (CRT) screen thatwill talk to you in a language of your choice. The  service works somethinglike this, when you find a (NEW CARD CALLER PHONE), all you do is follow theinstructions on the (CRT) screen, then you insert the (NEW CARD CALLER CARD)and there is a strip of magnetic tape on the card  which reads the number, thusno one can hear you saying your number or if there were a bug in the phone,notouch tones will be heard!! You can also bill the call to a third party. thatis  one that I am not totally clear on yet! The phone is supposed to tell youhow it can be done. That is after you  have inserted your card and lifted thereceiver!                                    Page 75                        The Official Phreaker's Manual         :%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%:         :%                                                        %:         :%                     AT&T FORGERY                       %:         :%              Written by The Blue Buccaneer             %:         :%                                                        %:         :% CALL THE EVERLASTING SPEED DEMON BBS AT (415) 522-3074 %:         :%   Uploaded by Elric of Imrryr of Lunatic Labs UnLtd    %:         :%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%:Here is a very simple way to either:[1] Play an incredibly cruel and realistic joke on a phreaking friend.                                     -OR-[2] Provide yourself with everything you ever wanted to be an AT&T person.   All you need to do is get your hands on some AT&T paper and/or businesscards.  To do this you can either go down to your local business office andswipe a few or call up somewhere like WATTS INFORMATION and ask them to sendyou their information package. They will send you:1. A nice letter (with the AT&T logo letterhead) saying "Here is the info."2. A business card (again with AT&T) saying who the sales representative is.3. A very nice color booklet telling you all about WATTS lines.4. Various billing information. (Discard as it is very worthless)   Now take the piece of AT&T paper and the AT&T business card down to yourlocal print/copy shop.  Tell them to run you off several copies of each, but toleave out whatever else is printed on the business card/letter.  If they refuseor ask why, take your precious business elsewhere.(This should only cost you around $2.00 total)   Now take the copies home and either with your typewriter, MAC, or Fontrix,add whatever name, address, telephone number, etc. you like. (I would recommendjust changing the name on the card and using whatever information was on thereearlier)   And there you have official AT&T letters and business cards.  As mentionedearlier, you can use them in several ways.  Mail a nice letter to someone youhate (on AT&T paper..hehehe) saying that AT&T is onto them or something likethat.  (Be sure to use correct English and spelling)  (Also do not hand writethe letter!  Use a typewriter! - Not Fontrix as AT&T doesn't use OLD ENGLISH orASCII BOLD when they type letters.  Any IBM typewriter will do perfectly)   Another possible use (of many, I guess) is (if you are old enough to lookthe part) to use the business card as some sort of fake id.   The last example of uses for the fake AT&T letters & b.cards is mentioned inmy textfile, BASIC RADIO CALLING.

The operator reports to the Group Chief, and S/He willsolve 100% of your problems, but the chances of getting S/He on the line arenill.    If a lineman (the guy who works out on the poles) or an installation mangives you the works ask to speak to the Installation Foreman, that workswonders.    Here is some other bell jargon, that might come in handy if you are havingtrouble with the line. Or they can be used to lie your way out ofsituations....     An Erling is a line busy for 1 hour, used mostly in traffic studies APermanent Signal is that terrible howling you get if you disconnect, but don'thang up.     Everyone knows what a busy signal is, but some idiots think that is the*Actual* ringing of the phone, when it just is a tone "beeps" when the phone isringing, wouldn't bet on this though, it can (and does) get out of sync.     When you get a busy signal that is 2 times as fast as the normal one, theperson you are trying to reach isn't really on the phone, (he might be), it isactually the signal that a trunk line somewhere is busy and they haven't orcan't reroute your call. Sometimes you will get a Recording, or if you getnothing at all (Left High & Dry in fone terms) all the recordings are beingused and the system is really overused, will probably go down in a littlewhile. This happened when Kennedy was shot, the system just couldn't handle thecalls. By the way this is called the "reorder signal" and the trunk line is"blocked".     One more thing, if an overseas call isn't completed and doesn't generateany money for AT&T, is is called an "Air & Water Call".                                    Page 78                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                      [ESSENCE OF TELEPHONE CONFERENCING]                                 [WRITTEN BY:]                               [FOREST  RANGER]     TELEPHONE CONFERENCING IS AN EASY WAY OF GETTING MANY FRIENDS TOGETHER ATONCE. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED EASILY WITH LITTLE OR NO TROUBLE WHAT SO EVER.THE TECHNIQUES THAT I WILL TEACH YOU DO NOT REQUIRE A BLUE BOX OR A TOUCH TONEPHONE LINE. THE ONLY PREREQUISITE IS THAT YOU HAVE A PHONE THAT HAS A TONESWITCH ON IT OR HAVE A HOOKABLE TOUCH TONE KEYPAD. NOW, IF YOU ARE THE PARANOIDTYPE OF PERSON AND REFUSE TO USE YOUR OWN PHONE OUT OF YOUR HOUSE THEN HERE ARESOME SIMPLE WAYS OF GETTING CONFERENCES STARTED FROM ANOTHER PHONE. GO TO AMALL OR A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW THE PHONE IS BEING PAYED FOR BY THE BUSINESS ITIS IN.    NOW THERE ARE TWO TO CALL THE CONFERENCE OPERATOR; DIAL "0" TO GET YOURLOCAL OPERATOR SO SHE CAN PUT YOU THROUGH TO THE CONFERENCE OPERATOR OR DIALTHE CONFERENCE OPERATOR DIRECTLY IF YOU HAVE THE NUMBER HANDY. THE SYSTEM YOUWILL BE LINKED UP TO IS CALLED THE "ALLIANCE" SYSTEM. THERE ARE THREE BRANCHES;1000,2000,3000.    NOW ONCE YOU HAVE GOTTEN THE CONFERENCE OPERATOR YOU TELL HER YOU WOULDLIKE TO START A CONFERENCE AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF IT. SHEWILL THEN PROCEED TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR NAME AND NUMBER. YOU WILL THEN GIVE HER AFAKE NAME AND THE NUMBER OF THE PAY PHONE. SHE WILL HANG UP AND CALL YOU BACKONCE SHE HAS CHECKED THE NUMBER. THEY USUALLY DON'T REALIZE IT IS A PAYPHONE SODON'T THINK IT WON'T WORK! NOW ONCE THE OPERATOR HAS GIVEN YOU CONTROL YOU WILLTHEN PROCEED TO HACK MY VOICE PHONE AND PUT ME ON THE CONFERENCE.    NOW, THE OTHER WAY OF STARTING A CONFERENCE IN WHICH YOU DON'T GET A LIVEOPERATOR IS A "PBX". WITH THIS YOU WILL CALL A PBX NUMBER AND YOU WILL THENRECEIVE A RECORDING OF A BUSINESS OR OFFICE CO. THEN WHEN THE RECORDING IS OVERYOU WILL HERE A BEEP...THEN AFTER ABOUT 10-30 SECONDS AFTER THE BEEP YOU WILLGET A DIAL TONE ON THE ON THE END OF THE PBX.  YOU WILL THEN TYPE THE PBX CODEWHICH WILL THEN RESPOND WITH A RECORDING WELCOMING YOU TO THE CONFERENCINGNETWORK (WHICH WILL IN MOST IF NOT ALL BE THE "ALLIANCE" SYSTEM).    IT WILL BE SELF EXPLANATORY FROM THERE. NOW IF YOU DON'T WISH TO CALL THECONFERENCE OPERATOR EITHER WAY ALREADY EXPLAINED THEN THERE IS A WAS OF GETTINGYOUR FRIENDS IN CONFERENCE. THIS IS DONE OVER A LOOP EXTENSION. NO ONE WILLHAVE CONTROL, BUT YOU WILL STILL BE ON CONFERENCE. THIS IS CALLED THE SEVENLINE LOOP EXTENSION. THIS MEANS YOU CAN HAVE UP TO SEVEN MEMBERS, BUT THAT ISIT! THE NUMBER IS IN LA, CA. 213-206-2820. THE LAST WAY I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOUIF YOU ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF A CONFERENCE IS TO GO TO PAY PHONE LIKE IMENTIONED BEFORE ANY MAKE SURE SOME BUSINESS PAYS THE BILL FOR IT THEN CALL THECONFERENCE OPERATOR IN THE FASHIONS MENTIONED AND ASK THE CONFERENCE OPERATORTO PLACE CONFERENCE CALLS.    THE WILL THEN ASK FOR THE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE TO PUT ON CONFERENCE, YOUGIVE HER THE NUMBERS AND SHE WILL PUT YOU ALL ON CONFERENCE.  WHEN YOU ARE DONEYOU WILL HANG UP ON HER SO THERE WILL BE NO ONE IN CONTROL.THAT MEANS THECONFERENCE WILL BE BILLED TO THE PAYPHONE AND NO ONE CAN BE BLAMED FOR THECONFERENCE DUE TO NO ONE BEING IN CONTROL! ***NOTE*** THE CONFERENCE OPERATORWILL NOT BE ON WHILE YOU ARE ALL TALKING!

I HAVE ENCLOSED A SCHEMATIC FOR A SIMPLEWIRETAP & INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOOKING UP A TAPE RECORDER CONTROL RELAY TO THEPHONE LINE.     FIRST I'LL DISCUSS TAPS A LITTLE. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAPS.THERE ARE TRANSMITTERS, WIRED TAPS AND INDUCTION TAPS TO NAME A FEW.  WIRED ANDWIRELESS TRANSMITTERS MUST BE PHYSICALLY CONNECTED TO THE LINE BEFORE THEY'LLDO ANY GOOD. ONCE A WIRELESS TAP IS CONNECTED TO THE LINE, IT CAN TRANSMIT ALLCONVERSATIONS OVER A LIMITED RANGE. THE PHONES IN THE HOUSE CAN EVEN BEMODIFIED TO PICK UP CONVERSATIONS IN THE ROOM & TRANSMIT THEM TOO!  THESE TAPSARE USUALLY POWERED OFF THE PHONE LINE, BUT CAN HAVE AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE.     WIRED TAPS, ON THE OTHER HAND, NEED NO POWER SOURCE, BUT A WIRE MUST BERUN FROM THE LINE TO THE LISTENER OR TO A TRANSMITTER.  THERE ARE OBVIOUSADVANTAGES OF WIRELESS TAPS OVER WIRED ONES.  THERE IS ONE TYPE OF WIRELESS TAPTHAT LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL TELEPHONE MIKE.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS REPLACE THEORIGINAL MIKE WITH THIS & IT'LL TRANSMIT ALL CONVERSATIONS!    THERE IS AN EXOTIC TYPE OF WIRED TAP KNOWN AS THE 'INFINITY TRANSMITTER' OR'HARMONICA BUG'.  IN ORDER TO HOOK UP ONE OF THESE, YOU NEED ACCESS TO THETARGET TELEPHONE.  IT HAS A TONE DECODER & SWITCH INSIDE.  WHEN IT ISINSTALLED, SOMEONE CALLS THE TAPPED PHONE & *BEFORE* IT RINGS, BLOWS A WHISTLEOVER THE LINE.  THE X-MITTER RECEIVES THE TONE & PICKS UP THE PHONE VIA ARELAY.  THE MIKE ON THE PHONE IS ACTIVATED SO THE CALLER CAN HEAR ALLCONVERSATIONS IN THE ROOM.     THERE IS A SWEEP TONE TEST AT 415/BUG-1111 WHICH CAN BE USED TO DETECT ONOF THESE TAPS.  IF ONE OF THESE IS ON YOUR LINE & THE TEST # SENDS THE CORRECTTONE, YOU'LL HEAR A CLICK.     INDUCTION TAPS HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE OVER TAPS THAT MUST BE PHYSICALLYWIRED TO THE PHONE.  THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE TOUCHING THE PHONE IN ORDER TO PICKUP THE CONVERSATION. THEY WORK ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS THE LITTLE SUCTION-CUPTAPE RECORDER MIKES YOU CAN GET AT RADIO SHACK. INDUCTION MIKES CAN BE HOOKEDUP TO A TRANSMITTER OR BE WIRED. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGEUSING THE PHONE:     A SALESMAN WALKS INTO AN OFFICE & MAKES A FONE CALL.  HE FAKES THECONVERSATION, BUT WHEN HE HANGS UP HE SLIPS SOME FOAM-RUBBER CUBES UNDER THEHANDSET, SO THE FONE IS STILL OFF THE HOOK.  THE CALLED PARTY CAN STILL HEARALL CONVERSATIONS IN THE ROOM. WHEN SOMEONE PICKS UP THE FONE, THE CUBES FALLAWAY UNNOTICED.     I USE A TAP ON MY LINE TO MONITOR WHAT AE-PRO IS DOING WHEN IT AUTO-DIALS,SINCE IT DOESN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HANDSET ON THE APPLE CAT II.  I CAN ALSOHOOK UP THE TAP TO A CASSETTE RECORDER OR AMPLIFIER. HERE IS THE SCHEMATIC:-------)!----)!(------------->             )!( CAP ^       )!(             )!(             )!(             )!(     ^^^^^---)!(------------->       ^  100K       !       !<INPUTTHE 100K POT IS USED FOR VOLUME.  IT SHOULD BE ON ITS HIGHEST (LEASTRESISTANCE) SETTING IF YOU HOOK A SPEAKER ACROSS THE OUTPUT, BUT IT SHOULD BESET ON ITS HIGHEST RESISTANCE FOR A TAPE RECORDER OR AMPLIFIER.  YOU MAY FINDIT NECESSARY TO ADD ANOTHER 10-40K.  THE CAPACITOR SHOULD BE AROUND .47 MFD.IT'S ONLY PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT THE RELAY IN THE CO FROM TRIPPING & THINKING                                    Page 81                        The Official Phreaker's ManualYOU HAVE THE FONE OFF THE HOOK.

YOU MAY WANT TO EXPERIMENTWITH THE X-FORMER FOR THE BEST OUTPUT.     HOOKING UP A TAPE RECORDER CONTROL RELAY IS EAST.  JUST ONE OF THE FONEWIRES (USU.

AND INATURALLY CARRIED ON A CONVERSATION WITH THE NEW JERSEY BELL FONE INSTALLERWHEN HE CAME TO PUT IN MY MODEM LINE. THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO FONE TAPPING,AND SEVERAL INTERESTING DETAILS CAME TO LIGHT. HE SWORE UP AND DOWN THAT BELLHAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WIRE TAPPING. HE SAID THE SUPERVISOR RECEIVES SEALEDORDERS FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE, MERELY PASSING THEM ON TO THE LINEMEN.  THENTHE LINEMEN FOLLOW THE ORDERS TO GO UP ON THE POLES AND MARK THE PAIR IN THE"CAN" THAT FIT THE FONE LINE IN QUESTION, AND THEN LEAVE THE SITE.     ONE DAY, OUR LINEMAN DROVE BACK BY THE POLE HE HAD MARKED EARLIER IN THEDAY, AND SAW A BELL TRUCK.  WONDERING WHO IT WAS, HE STOPPED TO ASK.  THE GUY)zYSTERY MAN AS ONE OF THE LINEMEN FOR THE AREA, HEASKED HIS SUPERVISOR WHO IT COULD HAVE BEEN.  HIS SUPERVISOR CURTLY TOLD HIM TOFORGET THE ENTIRE INCIDENT.     THE LINEMAN TOLD US THAT IN THE OLD DAYS THE TELCO AND THE PROSECUTOR'SOFFICE WORKED HAND-IN-HAND.  THEY WOULD LET THE AUTHORITIES RIGHT INTO THE COTO LISTEN IN ON CONVERSATIONS.  BUT THIS ENDED AROUND 1973 WHEN SOMEONE SUEDJERSEY BELL BECAUSE OF THIS TOO CLOSE INTERACTION.  THE TELCO THEN REALIZEDTHAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THAT FAR IN  ORDER TO HELP THE POLICE.  AFTER THISTHEY GRADUALLY BROKE FROM THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.  NOW THE FONE COMPANY MERELYMARKS THE LINES, AND THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE HANDLES THE REST.  HE ALSO SAIDTHAT NOW THE POLICE SOMETIMES USE ULTRASONIC WAVES BOUNCED OFF OF WINDOW PANESTO LISTEN TO SUSPECTS, REMOVING ALL CONTACT WITH THE FONE LINES.  SINCE THEPRESENCE OF A FONE COMPANY TRUCK MESSING WITH TELEPHONE WIRES IS TAKEN FORGRANTED BY THE GENERAL POPULACE, THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE ALSO HAS A COUPLE OF THEMFOR UNDERCOVER WORK.  SINCE THEY GOT THEM BACK IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF BELLFRIENDLINESS, THE TRUCKS TEND TO BE THE OLDER MODELS, WITH OUTDATED GEAR. THELINEMAN TOLD US A SURE WAY TO IDENTIFY THE LOCAL POLICE'S TRUCKS:  THEY HAVEWOODEN LADDERS.  NEW JERSEY BELL SWITCHED OVER TO PLASTIC ONES YEARS AGO.     CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION WITH THE LINEMAN, WE COVERED THE BREAKUP.  NEWJERSEY BELL NOW NO LONGER GIVES AS MUCH OVERTIME AS IT ONCE DID.  THE LINEMANCOMPLAINED THAT HIS STANDARD OF LIVING HAD GONE DOWN SINCE THE BREAKUP AS HE NOLONGER HAS AS MUCH TAKE HOME PAY.  THE BREAKUP HAS CAUSED A TOTAL SEVERING OFTIES WITH AT&T.  HE PROFESSED TOTAL IGNORANCE ABOUT LONG DISTANCE CALLING.  HEHAD ORIGINALLY GONE WITH AT&T, BUT DISLIKED FIXING PBX'S AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS.AS SOON AS HE COULD, HE SWITCHED BACK TO THE LOCAL OPERATING COMPANY.     HE TOLD US ABOUT A TECHNICAL INSTITUTE WESTERN UNION WAS OPERATINGSOMEWHERE IN THE MIDWEST.  HE HAD GONE THERE TO LEARN ABOUT THE VARIOUS TYPESOF SWITCHING SYSTEMS.  ON CAMPUS WAS A GIGANTIC, MULTI-STORY BUILDING SPLIT UPINTO ROOMS APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF GYMNASIUMS.  IN EACH WAS A FULLYOPERATIONAL SCALE MODEL OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS SWITCHING SYSTEMS.  WESTERNELECTRIC MANUFACTURES, INCLUDING ALL THE ESS AND CROSSBAR MACHINES, AS WELL ASSOME STEP-BY-STEP, AND SEVERAL TYPES OF PBX'S.  THEY TROUBLE-SHOT AND REPAIREDPROBLEMS IN THESE MACHINES IN ORDER TO LEARN ABOUT ACTUAL OPERATING EQUIPMENT.     WE TALKED ABOUT THE LOCAL SWITCHING EQUIPMENT, WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A                                    Page 83                        The Official Phreaker's Manual#1A ESS.  ACCORDING TO HIM, SOON ALL THE LOCAL CO'S WILL BE RUN AUTOMATICALLYFROM CENTRAL LOCATIONS CALLED "HUBS".  THE "HUB" HANDLES ANY OVERLOAD BETWEENCENTRAL OFFICES THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE DREADED "GRIDLOCK" OF THE FONE SYSTEM.  IFTHE INTEROFFICE SIGNALING LINES GET OVERLOADED, THE CALLS ARE REROUTED THROUGHTHE HUB.  THE HUB ALSO SERVES AS A CENTRAL SPOT WHERE TROUBLES AT THE LOCAL COARE HANDLED IN THE FIRST STAGES OF TROUBLE-SHOOTING.  THE "HUB" CONCEPT ISALIVE AND WELL IN OUR LOCAL AREA, WITH #5 ESS, THE THIRD INSTALLED IN THEENTIRE NATION, RUNNING THE WHOLE OPERATION.     WHEN HE WAS GETTING READY TO LEAVE HE THANKED US FOR THE INTERESTINGCONVERSATION, AND WE WAVED AT HIM AS HE  PULLED OUT.  I NOW NOT ONLY HAD A NEWFONE LINE, BUT ALSO A LOT OF USEFUL AND INTERESTING INFO, AS WELL AS THESATISFACTION OF A FRIENDLY CHAT.     THE LESSON IS CLEAR.  WHENEVER A BELL EMPLOYEE VISITS YOUR HOUSE, FELLPHREE TO ASK WHATEVER YOU WANT, WITHIN REASON.  MOST ARE EXTREMELY WILLING TOSHOOT THE BULL ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING OF WHICH THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE.  AT FIRST,MERELY JOKE WITH THEM LIGHTHEARTEDLY, IN ORDER TO GET THEM OFF THERE GUARD.LEGIT QUESTIONS ASKABLE BY A NORMAL CUSTOMER, SUCH AS EQUAL ACCESS CUTOVERS,WILL GET THEM ROLLING, LEAVING YOU TO DIRECT THE CONVERSATION WHEREVER YOULIKE.  ASKING ABOUT THE BREAKUP AND HOW IT AFFECTED THEM IS A SURE FIRE WAY TOGET THEM TALKING.  QUESTIONS LIKE "HOW DOES THE FONE NETWORK WORK?" ALSO AREGOOD, ESPECIALLY IF YOU GUIDE THEM INTO  THE DISCUSSION OF SWITCHINGTECHNOLOGY. MOST BELL EMPLOYEES ARE REALLY GLAD TO TALK TO SOMEONE.  REMEMBER,THEY USUALLY INTERACT WITH DISGRUNTLED CUSTOMERS WITH COMPLAINTS.  THEIRSPOUSES PROBABLY YELL AT THEM, AND THEIR SUPERVISORS EITHER COMPLAIN ABOUTTHEIR PERFORMANCE OR IGNORE THEM. SOCIETY AT LARGE JUST DOESN'T CARE ABOUTTHEM.  THEY'RE MOST PROBABLY DISENCHANTED WITH THE WORLD AT LARGE, AND MAYBEEVEN DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR JOBS.  THE CHANCE TO TALK TO SOME ONE WHO MERELYWANTS TO LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY IS A WELCOME CHANGE.  THEY WILL TALK ON AND ONABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING, FROM TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO THEIR HOME LIFE AND THEIRCHILDHOOD.  THE POSSIBILITIES FOR SOCIAL ENGINEERING ARE ENDLESS.  REMEMBER,BELL EMPLOYEES ARE HUMANS, TOO.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LISTEN.                                    Page 84                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                         [PEN REGISTERING AND TRACING]                                 [WRITTEN BY:]                               [FOREST  RANGER]  PEN REGISTERING IS A SPECIAL DEVICE USED BY AT&T.

It should be listed at the front of the white      "Hello, this is Mr. Korman, I'm moving to California and would like tohave  my phone service disconnected. I'm at the airport now.  I'm calling froma payphone, my number is  [414] 445 5005. You can send my final bill to:(somewhere in California).

Say :     "Hello, I'd like to order a Phone Book for Upper Volta (or any out-of-theway area with Direct Dialing).  This is Scott Korman, ship to 3119 N. 44th St.Milwaukee, WI 53216.  Yes, I under stand it will cost $xx($25-$75!!). Thankyou."METHOD 3-PHONE CALLSCall up a PBX, enter the code and get an outside line.  Then dial 0+ the numberdesired to call.  You will hear a bonk and then an operator.  Say, "I'd like tocharge this to my home phone at 414-445-5005. Thank you."

Say you'd like callwaiting, forwarding, 3 way, etc.  Once again you are the famed loser ScottKorman.  He pays-you laugh.  You don't know how funny it was talking to him,and wondering what those clicks he kept hearing were.METHOD 5-CHANGED & UNPUBDo the same as in #4, but say you'd like to change and unlist your (Scott's)number.

Around Christmas time, go toToys 'R' Us.  Get everyone at the customer service or manager's desk away("Hey, could you help me").  then you get on their phone and dial (usually dial9 first) and the business office again. This time, say you are from Toys 'R'Us, and you'd like to add call forwarding to 445-5005.  Scott will get 100-600calls a day!!!METHOD 7-RUSSIAN CALLER    Call a payphone at 10:00 PM.  Say to the operator that you'd like to book acall to Russia.  Say you are calling from a payphone, and your number is thatof the loser to fry (e.g. 445-5005). She will say that she'll have to call yaback in 5 hours, and you ok that. Meanwhile the loser (e.g.) Scott, will get acall at 3:00 AM from an operator saying that the call he booked to Russia isready.IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LEAVE E-MAIL FOR ME ON ANY BOARD I'M ON.The Iron SoldierTSF-The Second Foundation!                                    Page 87                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                           INTERESTING THINGS TO DO                                 ON STEP LINES                      ===================================  IF YOU HAVE STEP LINES IN YOUR PREFIX, (A GOOD WAY OF CHECKING TO SEE IF YOUHAVE STEP IS TO LOOK AT THE PAYPHONES AROUND YOUR HOUSE, IF THEY ARE ROTARY,THEN YOU HAVE STEP, IF NOT, YOUR OUTTA LUCK.)  FROM YOUR HOUSE DIAL "0", (THIS WILL NOT WORK AT A PAYPHONE).

Six other computers were also seized in this investigation,including those of Store Manager [perhaps they mean Swap Shop  Manager? -Shark] who ran a BBS of his own, Beowolf, Red Barchetta, the Vampire, NJ HackShack, sysop of the NJ Hack Shack BBS, and that of the sysop of the TreasureChest BBS.     Immediately after this action, members of 2600 contacted the media, whowere completely unaware of any of the raids.  They began to bombard theMiddlesex County Prosecutor's Office with questions and a press conference  wasannounced for July 16.  The system operator of the Private Sector BBS attemptedto attend along with reporters from 2600.  They were effectively  thrown offthe premises.  Threats were made to charge them with trespassing and othercrimes.  An officer who had at first received them civilly was  threatened withthe loss of his job if he didn't get them removed promptly.  Then the car waschased out of the parking lot.  Perhaps prosecutor Alan Rockoff was afraid thathe presence of some technically literate reporters would ruin the effect of hispress release on the public. As it happens, he didn't need our help.     The next day the details of the press conference were reported to thepublic by the press.  As Rockoff intended, paranoia about hackers ran rampant.Headlines got as ridiculous as hackers ordering tank parts by telephone fromTRW and moving satellites with their home computers in order to make free phonecalls.  These and even more exotic stories were reported by otherwiserespectable media sources. The news conference understandably made the frontpage of most of the major newspapers in the US, and was a major news item asfar away as Australia and in the United Kingdom due to the sensationalism ofthe claims.  We will try to explain why these claims may have been made in thisissue.     On July 18 the operator of The Private Sector was formally chargedwith"computer conspiracy" under the above law, and released in the custody ofhis parents.  The next day the American Civil Liberties Union took over hisdefense.  The ACLU commented that it would be very hard for Rockoff to prove aconspiracy just "because the same information, construed by the prosecutor tobe illegal, appears on two bulletin boards." especially as Rockoff admittedthat "he did not believe any of the defendants knew each other."  The ACLUbelieves that the system operator's rights were violated, as he was assumed to                                    Page 89                        The Official Phreaker's Manualbe involved in an illegal activity just because of other people underinvestigation who happened to have posted messages on his board.    In another statement which seems to confirm Rockoff's belief in guilt byassociation, he announced the next day that "630 people were being investigatedto determine if any used their computer equipment fraudulently."  We believethis is only the user list of the NJ Hack Shack, so the actual list of those tobe investigated may turn out to be almost 5 times that.  The sheer overwhelmingdifficulty of this task may kill this investigation, especially as they findthat many hackers simply leave false information.  Computer hobbyists allacross the country have already been called by the Bound Brook, New Jerseyoffice of the FBI.  They reported that the FBI agents used scare tactics inorder to force confessions or to provoke them into turning in others.  We wouldlike to remind those who get called that there is nothing inherently wrong orillegal in calling any ANY BBS, nor in talking about ANY activity.  The FBIwould not comment on the case as it is an "ongoing investigation" and in thehands of the local prosecutor.  They will soon find that many on the PrivateSector BBS's user list are data processing managers, telecommunicationssecurity people, and others who are interested in the subject of the BBS,hardly the underground community of computer criminals depicted at the newsconference.  The Private Sector BBS was a completely open BBS, and police andsecurity people were even invited on in order to participate.  The BBS was farfrom the "elite" type of underground telecom boards that Rockoff attempted toportray.     Within two days, Rockoff took back almost all of the statements he hadmade at the news conference, as AT&T and the DoD [Department of Defense -Shark] discounted the claims he had made.  He was understandably unable to findreal proof of Private Sector's alleged illegal activity, and was faced withhaving to return the computer equipment with nothing to show for his effort.Rockoff panicked, and on July 31, the system operator had a new charge againsthim, "wiring up his computer as a blue box."  Apparently this was referring tohis Novation Applecat modem which is capable of generating any hertz tone overthe phone line.  By this stretch of imagination an Applecat could produce a2600 hertz tone as well as the MF which is necessary for "blue boxing."However, each and every other owner of an Applecat or any other modem that cangenerate its own tones therefore has also "wired up his computer as a blue box"by merely installing the modem. This charge is so ridiculous that Rockoffprobably will never bother to press it.  However, the wording of WIRING UP THECOMPUTER gives rockoff an excuse to continue to hold onto the computer longerin his futile search for illegal activity.     "We have requested that the prosecutors give us more specificinformation," said Arthur Miller, the lawyer for The Private Sector. "Thecharges are so vague that we can't really present a case at this point."Miller will appear in court on August 16 to obtain this information.  He isalso issuing a demand for the return of the equipment and, if the prosecutorsdon't cooperate, will commence court proceedings against them.  "They haven'tbeen pa::icularly cooperative," he said.     Rockoff probably will soon reconsider taking Private Sector's case tocourt, as he will have to admit he just didn't know what he was doing when heseized the BBS.  The arrest warrant listed only "computer conspiracy" againstPrivate Sector, which is much more difficult to prosecute than the multitude ofcharges against some of the other defendants, which include credit card fraud,toll fraud, the unauthorized entry into computers, and numerous others.     Both Rockoff and the ACLU mentioned the Supreme Court in their press                                    Page 90                        The Official Phreaker's Manualreleases, but he will assuredly take one of his stronger cases to test the newNew Jersey computer crime law.  by seizing the BBS just because of supposedactivities discussed on it, Rockoff raises constitutional questions.  DarrellPaster, a lawyer who centers much of his work on computer crime, says the NewJersey case is "just another example of local law enforcement getting on thebandwagon of crime that has come into vogue to prosecute, and they haveproceeded with very little technical understanding, and in the process theyhave abused many people's constitutional rights.  What we have developing is amini witch hunt which is analogous to some of the arrests at day care centers,where they sweep in and arrest everybody, ruin reputations, and then find thatthere is only one or two guilty parties."  We feel that law enforcement, notunderstanding the information on the BBS, decided to strike first and askquestions later.     2600 magazine and the sysops of the Private Sector BBS stand fully behindthe system operator.  As soon as the equipment is returned, the BBS will goback up.  We ask all our readers to do their utmost to support us in ourefforts, and to educate as many of the public as possible that a hacker is nota computer criminal.  We are all convinced of our sysop's innocence, and awaitRockoff's dropping of the charges.NOTE:  Readers will notice that our reporting of the events are quite differentthan those presented in the media and by the Middlesex County Prosecutor.  Wecan only remind you that we are much closer to the events at hand than themedia is, and that we are much more technologically literate than the MiddlesexCounty Prosecutor's Office.  The Middlesex County Prosecutor has already takenback many of his statements, after the contentions were disproven by AT&T andthe DoD.  One problem is that the media and the police tend to treat the sevencases as one case, thus the charges against and activities of some of thehackers has been extended to all of the charged.  We at 2600 can only speakabout the case of Private Sector.                                    Page 91                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                                   Chapter 4   By now I assume that the reader has a fair idea of what phreaking is, andknow a little bit about how to go about it.  From now on, I will assume thatthe reader has read all the material before this or understands all thematerial covered.  Now we will take a journey into the "Basics ofTelecommunications" and learn a little about how everything works, and isrelated to everything else.  This series of articles is extremely good andshould be read by all levels of phreaks.   As we go further into the advanced world of phreaking, we come closer to theedge of technology.  As we approach it, everything seems to become larger andmore complicated.  We notice that many things that were possible aren'tanymore.  Blue boxing is starting to become the only method of exploration asEqual Access looms nearer and nearer.  As it stands now, equal access is here,and many LD services such as Sprint and MCI will be tougher to hack.  Extenderswill become more used and abused, which will cause them to get access codesmiles long...   Blue boxing becomes harder as all Bell switching and transmission facilitiesgo under to CCIS.  Then to further complicate things, digital microwave, fiberoptic, and satellite transmission are all coming to be digital and do notrecognize 2600hz for the hang up signal.  I predict that around 1990, blueboxes will be obsolete from all major cities.  A new type of box will have tobe invented, or you'll have to get two fone line to phreak with, on to placethe actual call and the other to tap into a COSMOS computer to change thestatus of the call from toll to toll-free, ie. 800#.   Well somethings will change for the better, with ISDN you'll get 144k bpslines and some other neat stuff.                                    Page 92                        The Official Phreaker's Manual         ************* << BIOC AGENT 003'S COURSE IN >> *************         *                                                          *         *             $%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$            *         *                 BASIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS                 *         *             $%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$%$            *         *                         PART II                          *         *                                                          *         ************************************************************                                   PREFACE:         <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>    IN PART II, WE WILL EXPLORE THE VARIOUS SPECIAL BELL#'S, SUCH AS: CN/A,AT&T NEWSLINES, LOOPS, 99XX #'S, ANI, RINGBACK, AND A FEW OTHERS.                                     CN/A:         <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>    CN/A, WHICH STANDS FOR CUSTOMER NAME AND ADDRESS, ARE BUREAUS THAT EXIST SOTHAT AUTHORIZED BELL EMPLOYEES CAN FIND OUT THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANYCUSTOMER IN THE BELL SYSTEM.

I THINK THAT THEBEST WAY THAT THIS IS UNDERSTOOD IS THE WAY THAT PHRED PHREEK EXPLAINED IT...   "NO SELF-RESPECTING PHONE PHREAK CAN GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT ALOOP IS, HOW TO USE ONE, AND THE TYPES THAT ARE AVAILABLE.  THE LOOP IS A GREATALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION MEDIUM THAT HAS MANY POTENTIAL USES THAT HAVEN'T EVENBEEN TAPPED YET. IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN WHAT A LOOP IS, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TOVISUALIZE TWO PHONE NUMBERS (LINES) JUST FLOATING AROUND IN THE TELCO CENTRALOFFICE (CO).  NOW, IF YOU (AND A FRIEND PERHAPS) WERE TO CALL THESE TWO NUMBERSAT THE SAME TIME, POOOOPFFF!!!, YOU ARE NOW CONNECTED TOGETHER. I HEAR WHATYOU'RE SAYING OUT THERE..., "BIG DEAL" OR "WHY SHOULD MA BELL COLLECT HERE TWOMSU'S (MESSAGE UNITS) FOR ONE LOUSY PHONE CALL!?" WELL... THINK AGAIN.  HAVEN'TYOU EVER WANTED SOMEONE TO CALL YOU BACK BUT, WERE RELUCTANT TO GIVE OUT YOURHOME PHONE NUMBER (LIKE THE LAST TIME YOU TRIED TO GET YOUR FRIEND'S UNLISTED #FROM THE BUSINESS OFFICE)? OR HOW ABOUT A COLLECT CALL TO YOUR FRIEND WAITINGON A LOOP, WHO WILL GLADLY ACCEPT THE CHARGES?  OR BETTER YET, STUMBLING UPON ALOOP THAT YOU DISCOVER THAT HAS MULTI-USER CAPABILITY (FOR THOSE LATE-NIGHTCONFERENCES).  BEST OF ALL IS FINDING A NON-SUPERVISED LOOP THAT DOESN'T CHARGEANY MSU'S OR TOLLS TO ONE OR BOTH PARTIES. EXAMPLE: MANY MOONS AGO, A LOOPAFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS 'THE 332 LOOP' WAS NON-SUP (IE, NON-SUPERVISED) ON THETONE SIDE. I HAD MY FRIEND IN CALIFORNIA DIAL THE FREE (NON-SUP) SIDE, (212)332-9906 AND I DIALED THE SIDE THAT CHARGED, 332-9900. AS YOU CAN SEE, I WASCHARGED ONE MSU, AND MY FRIEND AS CHARGED ZILCH, FOR AS LONG AS WE WISHED TOTALK!!!"                                  **********    AHHH...HAVE I PERKED YOUR INTEREST YET? IF SO, HERE IS HOW TO FIND A LOOPOF YOU VERY OWN.  FIRST, DO ALL OF YOU LOOP SEARCHING AT NIGHT! THIS IS BECAUSETHE LOOPS SERVE A GENUINE TEST FUNCTION WHICH TELCO USES DURING THE DAY.  (WEDON'T WANT TO RUN INTO AN IRATE LINEMAN NOW, DO WE?)  TO FIND A LOOP, HAVING 2#'S IS A DEFINITE PLUS.  IF NOT, HAVE A FRIEND TO DIAL #'S AT HIS LOCATION.LAST RESORT, TRY DIALING FROM TWO ADJACENT PAY PHONES. NOW GET YOUR TRUSTYWHITE PAGES (*), AND TURN TO THE PAGE WHERE IT LISTS THE # OF MSU'S FROM YOUREXCHANGE (OR EXCHANGES IN YOUR PRIMARY CALLING AREA) THE IDEA IS TO FIND A LOOP                                    Page 95                        The Official Phreaker's ManualTHAT IS WITHIN YOUR PRIMARY CALLING AREA OR IS ONLY 1 MSU IN YOUR AREA (CALLAREA A). THIS IS SO YOU DON'T GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO FIND A LOOP. WRITE DOWN ALLOF THESE EXCHANGES AND DO A 99XX SCAN OF THOSE EXCHANGES (99XX SCANNING WILL BEDISCUSSED SHORTLY).    BEFORE WE GET UP TO 99XX SCANNING, WE WILL LOOK AT SOME OTHER LOOP INFO:    LOOPS ARE FOUND PAIRS WHICH ARE USUALLY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER.  FOR EXAMPLE,IN NPA 212, WHERE THE INFAMOUS LOOPS ARE FOUND, THERE IS A STANDARD LOOPFORMAT:MANHATTAN & BRONX-------NNX-9977/9979BROOKLYN & QUEENS-------NNX-9900/9906    NNX IS THE EXCHANGE TO BE SCANNED. HERE ARE SOME LOOPS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUNDIN NYC.  THESE ARE USED MOSTLY BY PHREAKS AND CALL-IN LINES FOR PIRATE RADIOSTATIONS:212-220-9900/9906212-283-9977/9979212-352-9900/9906212-365-9977/9979212-529-9900/9906212-562-9977/9979212-982-9977/9979212-986-9977/9979    THE LOWER # IS THE TONE SIDE (SINGING SWITCH).  THE HIGHER # IS ALWAYSSILENT.  THE TONE DISAPPEARS ON THE LOWER # WHEN SOMEBODY DIALS IN THE OTHERSIDE OF THE LOOP. IF YOU ARE ON THE HIGHER #, YOU'LL HAVE TO LISTEN TO THECLICKS TO SEE IF SOMEBODY DIALED-IN.  THE NYC 982 & 986 LOOPS ARE DIFFERENTFROM OTHERS. USUALLY WHEN YOU PARK ON A LOOP, YOU WILL HEAR WHO EVER CALLS INON THE OTHER HALF.  WHEN THEY'RE DONE, THE NEXT CALLER (IF ANY) WILL BE QUEUEDIN, ONE AFTER ANOTHER. ON THE NYC 982 & 986, YOU SOMETIMES CAN'T GET ANY MORECALLERS IN AFTER THE FIRST. FURTHERMORE, IF YOU PARK ONE OF THESE LOOPS ANDTHERE IS NOBODY ON THE OTHER END FOR MORE THAN 4 MINUTES, YOU MAY BEAUTOMATICALLY DISCONNECTED. THESE LOOPS ARE GOOD FOR BACK-UP PURPOSES WHEN ALLOTHER LOOPS ARE BUSY.                                99XX SCANNING:         <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>    MOST EVERY EXCHANGE IN THE BELL SYSTEM HAS A WIDE VARIETY OF TEST #'S ANDOTHER "GOODIES," SUCH AS LOOPS. THESE "GOODIES" ARE USUALLY FOUND BETWEEN 9900AND 9999 IN YOUR LOCAL EXCHANGE.  IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND INITIATIVE, SCANYOUR EXCHANGE AND YOU MAY BECOME LUCKY!HERE ARE MY FINDINGS IN THE 914-268:9901 - VERIFICATION (RECORDING OF A/C AND EXCHANGE)9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CO9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CO9941 - CARRIER9960 - OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP)9963 - TONE (STOPS:  MUTED)9966 - CARRIER9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS TO CERTAIN TOUCH-TONE KEYS                                    Page 96                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    MOST OF THE #'S BETWEEN 9900 & 9999 WILL RING, BE BUSY, GO TO A SPECIALINTERCEPT OPERATOR ("WHAT #, PLEASE?"), OR WILL GO TO A "THE # YOU HAVEREACHED..." RECORDING.  WHAT YOU FIND DEPENDS UPON THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT INTHE EXCHANGE AND THE TELCO OPERATING COMPANY.    WHEN SEARCHING FOR LOOPS, YOU MAY FIND ONE OF THE FOLLOWING POSSIBILITIESWHEN YOU FIND ONE:1. YOU CAN HEAR THROUGH THE LOOP (NOT MUTED), BUT THERE IS A 1/2 SECOND CLICKEVERY 10 SECONDS THAT INTERRUPTS THE AUDIO.  THIS TYPE IS GOOD FOR BACK-UP USEBUT THE FUCKING CLICK IS SUPER ANNOYING.2. ONE SIDE OF THE LOOP IS BUSY; TRY IT AGAIN LATER.3. THE TONE DISAPPEARS, BUT YOU CANNOT HEAR THROUGH IT (THE LOOP IS MUTED, TRYAGAIN IN A MONTH OR SO)4. YOU GET "THE # YOU HAVE REACHED RECORDING."  NO LOOP HERE!    MOST LOOPS ARE MUTED (#3), BUT THEIR STATUS DOES CHANGES FROM TIME-TO-TIME.IT ALL DEPENDS IF THE TELCO MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL REMEMBER TO "THROW THESWITCH", IE, TURN OFF THE LOOP.    SINCE I HAVE DONE THE ABOVE 914-268 99XX SCAN, CONGERS (268) HAS INSTALLEDNEW SWITCHING EQUIPMENT (DMS100). SOME OF THE NUMBERS ARE THE SAME, BUT I HAVENOTICED THAT ON THE DMS100, THE RECORDINGS ARE ALSO STORED IN THIS AREA.268-9903, 9906, 9909, & 9912 ARE ALL DIFFERENT RECORDINGS.

AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IN MY 914-268 SCAN, I FOUND AMUTED LOOP AND A TONE SIDE.  914-268 FAILED TO COME UP WITH THE SILENT SIDE OFA LOOP!  THEREFORE, THERE IS NO LOOP IN THAT EXCHANGE.  I THEN SCANNED ANOTHEREXCHANGE IN MY PRIMARY CALLING AREA (914-634) AND I FOUND A LOOP!! "(914)634-9923/9924" SO, IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED, MOVE ONTO ANOTHER EXCHANGE.IF YOU USE THE BOX METHOD THAT I HAVE OUTLINED ABOVE, YOU WILL SEE A "T" & "I"NEXT TO EACH OTHER FOR A LOOP.   SOME EXCHANGES ARE SPECIAL.  FOR EXAMPLE, 914-623 IS A TESTING BUREAU. INTHIS EXCHANGE, NOT ONLY DID I FIND A LOOP, BUT I ALSO FOUND SEVERAL INTERESTINGTONES, NOISES, AND OTHER TEST FUNCTIONS. ALSO, THE MORE IMPORTANT THE EXCHANGEIS, THE MORE YOU WILL FIND. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 914-623, I FOUND WELL OVER 10 VOICE#'S!    ALSO, LOOPS ARE USUALLY, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY, FOUND IN THE 99XX SERIES. FOREXAMPLE: "(713) 324-1799/1499" IS A LOOP.THE PERFECT LOOP?  HERE IS WHAT I WOULD LOOK FOR:1. NON-SUP ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES. TO CHECK FOR A NON-SUP LOOP, GO TO ATONE-FIRST FORTRESS FONE AND DIAL THE #. IF IT ASKS FOR A DIME, IT ISSUPERVISED. IF THE CALL GOES THROUGH, THEN IT IS NON-SUPED!2. 800 LOOPS WOULD BE A PLUS.  THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY FOUND BETWEEN 9900 &9999 THOUGH.  I WOULD CHECK THE 1XXX SERIES FIRST.3. MULTI-USER LOOPS ARE ALSO A PLUS FOR THOSE LATE NIGHT CONFERENCES.    FINALLY, REMEMBER IT IS ONLY A LOCAL CALL TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU CO HAS INSTORE FOR YOU.  IF YOU FIND ANYTHING INTERESTING, BE SURE TO DROP ME A LINE.NOTE:  YOUR LOCAL WHITE PAGES CAN BE A VALUABLE ASSET. YOU CAN ALSO ORDER OTHERFONE BOOKS FROM YOUR BUSINESS OFFICE (USUALLY FREE FOR BOOKS WITHIN YOUROPERATING COMPANY'S DISTRICT).

FIRST, WERE YOU EVER SOMEWHERE AND THE FONE DIDN'THAVE A # PRINTED ON IT?  OR PERHAPS YOU WERE FOOLING AROUND IN SOME CANS (THOSELARGE BOXES ON FONE POLES THAT CONTAIN TERMINALS FOR LINEMAN USE--TO BEDISCUSSES IN A FUTURE CHAPTER.) AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THE LINE # IS.IN NPA 914, THE ANI IS 990.  IN NPA'S 212 & 516, ANI IS 958.  THIS VARIES FROMAREA TO AREA.HERE ARE SOME OTHER ANI'S THAT I HAVE SEEN:890-751-5191202-222-22221-XXX-1111    (IN SOME 914 AREAS, ESP. UNDER STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING, YOU HAVETO DIAL 1-990-1111)    TO FIND ANI FOR OTHER AREAS, CHECK 3 DIGITS #'S FIRST, USUALLY IN THE 9XXSERIES (EXCLUDING 911).  IN AREAS UNDER STEP-BY-STEP (TO BE DISCUSSED IN THENEXT PART), TRY 1-9XX-1111.    ANI MAY ALSO BE IN 99XX.

YOU WILL THEN GET A SECOND TONE, HANG-UP AGAIN AND THE FONE WILLRING.    IN NYC, IT IS ALSO 660, BUT YOU MAY HAVE TO PRESS 6 OR 7 BEFORE YOU HANG UPFOR THE FIRST TIME (IE, AT THE FIRST  TONE).    OTHER RINGBACK #'S THAT I HAVE SEEN ARE:26011                - THIS 5 DIGIT FORMAT IS USED PRIMARILY ON STEP-BY-STEP.THE LAST 2 DIGITS (11) ARE DUMMY DIGITS.890-897-XXXX         - XXXX ARE THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF THE FONE #.119911/11911/1199911 - GTENNX-9906/9907        - NPA 301, NNX IS THE EXCHANGE    THE REASON YOU GET THE TONE WHEN YOU PICK-UP AFTER IT RINGS IS BECAUSE INSOME AREAS, PEOPLE WERE USING RINGBACK AS AN IN-HOUSE INTERCOM.  THEY WOULDDIAL RINGBACK, AND WHEN IT STOPPED RINGING, THEY WOULD PICK-UP & TALK WITH THEPERSON WHO PICKED UP THE OTHER EXTENSION.  BELL DIDN'T LIKE THIS SINCE THERE ISUSUALLY ONLY 1 PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN EACH EXCHANGE THAT DOES THE RINGBACK. WHENPEOPLE USED THIS AS AN INTERCOM, LINEMEN & REPAIRMEN COULDN'T GET THROUGH!  INSOME AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDER STEP-BY-STEP, RINGBACK CAN STILL BE USED ASAN INTERCOM.

THEY ARE OWNED BYWESTERN UNION.  THESE SAC'S MAY ONLY BE REACHED VIA OTHER TWX MACHINES.  THESERUN AT 110 BAUD.  BESIDES THE TWX #'S, THESE MACHINES ARE ROUTED TO NORMALTELEPHONE #'S.  TWX MACHINES ALWAYS RESPOND WITH AN ANSWERBACK. FOR EXAMPLE,WU'S FYI TWX # IS (910) 988-5956, THE CORRESPONDING REAL NUMBER TO THIS IS(201) 279-5956.

AT&TPLANS TO USE IT SOON THOUGH.  THEY PLAN TO MAKE IT A TYPE OF FANCY CALLFORWARDING SERVICE.  IT WILL BE TARGETED TOWARDS SALESMEN ON THE RUN.    TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS, I'LL EXPLAIN IT WITH AN EXAMPLE. LET'S SAY JOEQ. SALESPIG WORKS FOR AT&T SECURITY AND HE IS ON THE RUN CHASING A PHREAKAROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ROYALLY SCREWED UP AN IMPORTANT COSMOS SYSTEM.  LET'SSAY THAT JOE'S 700 # IS (700) 382-5968. EVERY TIME JOE GOES TO A NEW HOTEL, HEDIALS A SPECIAL 700 #, ENTERS A CODE, AND THE # WHERE HE IS STAYING.  NOW, IFHIS BOSS RECEIVED SOME IMPORTANT INFO, ALL HE WOULD DO IS DIAL (700) 382-5968AND IT WOULD RING WHEREVER JOE LAST PROGRAMMED IT TO.

THERE ARE 6 OF THESE.  BAND 6 IS THE LARGEST AND YOU CAN CALL A BAND 6# FROM ANYWHERE IN THE US EXCEPT THE STATE WHERE THE CALL IS TERMINATED (THISIS WHY MOST COMPANIES HAVE ONE 800 # FOR THE COUNTRY AND THEN ANOTHER FOR JUSTONE STATE).  BAND 5 INCLUDES THE 48 CONTIGUOUS STATES.  ALL THE WAY DOWN TOBAND 1 WHICH INCLUDES ONLY THE STATES CONTIGUOUS TO THAT ONE. THEREFORE, LESSPEOPLE CAN REACH A BAND 1 INWATS # THAT A BAND 6 #.INTRASTATE INWATS #'S (IE, YOU CAN CALL IT FROM ONLY 1 STATE) ALWAYS HAVE A 2AS THE LAST DIGIT IN THE EXCHANGE (IE, 800-NX2-XXXX).  THE NXX ON 800 #'SREPRESENT THE AREA WHERE THE BUSINESS IS LOCATED.  FOR EXAMPLE, A # BEGINNINGWITH 800-431 WOULD TERMINATE AT A NEW YORK CO.800 #'S ALWAYS END UP IN A HUNT SERIES IN A CO.  THIS MEANS THAT IT TRIES THEFIRST # ALLOCATED TO THE COMPANY FOR THEIR 8P0 LINES; IF THIS IS BUSY IT WILLTHEN TRY THE NEXT #, ETC).  YOU MUST HAVE A MINIMUM OF TWO LINES PER EACH   800#.  FOR EXAMPLE, TRAVELNET USES A HUNT SERIES.  IF YOU DIAL (800) 521-8400, ITWILL FIRST TRY THE # ASSOCIATED WITH 8400; IF IT IS BUSY IT WILL GO TO THE NEXTAVAILABLE PORT, ETC.  INWATS CUSTOMERS ARE BILLED BY THE # OF HOURS OF CALLSTHAT ARE MADE TO THEIR #.OUTWATS (OUTWARD WATS):  OUTWATS ARE FOR MAKING OUTGOING CALLS ONLY. LARGECOMPANIES USE OUTWATS SINCE THEY RECEIVE BULK-RATE DISCOUNTS. SINCE OUTWATS #CANNOT HAVE INCOMING CALLS, THEY ARE IN THE FORMAT OF:                                    Page 102                        The Official Phreaker's Manual(800) *XX-XXXX    WHERE * IS THE DIGIT 0 OR 1 WHICH CANNOT BE DIALED UNLESS YOU BOX THE CALL.THE *XX IDENTIFIES THE TYPE OF SERVICE AND THE AREAS THAT THE COMPANY CANCALL.REMEMBER: INWATS + OUTWATS = WATS EXTENDER (SEE PART I)900:<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>    THIS DIAL-IT SAC IS A NATIONWIDE DIAL-IT SERVICE.

THIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THE CALLING # IS NOTAUTOMATICALLY RECORDED BY CAMA (CENTRALIZED AUTOMATIC MESSAGE ACCOUNTING) &FORWARDED FROM THE LOCAL OFFICE.  THIS COULD BE CAUSED BY EQUIPMENT FAILURES ORIF THE OFFICE IS NOT EQUIPPED FOR CAMA (MOST ARE).    <I ONCE HAD AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE HAPPEN TO ME & THE TSPS OPERATOR CAME ONAND SAID, "WHAT # ARE YOU CALLING FROM?"  OUT OF CURIOSITY, I GAVE HER THE # TOMY CO, SHE THANKED ME & THEN I WAS CONNECTED TO A CONVERSION THAT APPEARED TOBE BETWEEN A FIRE MAN & HIS WIFE.  THEN IT STARTED RINGING THE PARTY IORIGINALLY WANTED TO CALL & EVERYONE PHREAKED OUT (EXCUSE THE PUN). IIMMEDIATELY DROPPED THIS DUAL LINE CONFERENCE!>    YOU SHOULDN'T MESS WITH THE TSPS OPERATOR SINCE SHE KNOWS WHERE YOU ARECALLING FROM.  SHE ALSO KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE AT A FORTRESS FONE & SHECAN TRACE CALLS QUITE READILY.  OUT OF ALL THE OPERATORS, SHE IS ONE OF THEMOST DANGEROUS.INWARD OPERATOR:____________________________________________________________    THIS OPERATOR ASSISTS YOUR LOCAL TSPS ("0") OPERATOR IN CONNECTING CALLS.                                    Page 106                        The Official Phreaker's ManualSHE WILL NEVER QUESTION A CALL AS LONG AS THE CALL IS WITHIN HER SERVICE AREA.SHE CAN ONLY BE REACHED VIA OTHER OPERATORS OR BY A BLUE BOX.  FROM A BB, YOUWOULD DIAL KP+NPA+121+ST FOR THE INWARD OPERATOR THAT WILL HELP YOU CONNECT ANYCALLS WITHIN THAT NPA AREA ONLY. (BLUE BOXING WILL BE DISCUSSED IN A FUTUREPART OF BASIC TELCOM)DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE OPERATOR:____________________________________________________________    THIS IS THE OPERATOR THAT YOU ARE CONNECTED TO WHEN YOU DIAL:  411 ORNPA-555-1212.  SHE DOES NOT READILY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE CALLING FROM.  SHE DOESNOT HAVE ACCESS TO UNLISTED #'S, BUT SHE DOES KNOW IF AN UNLISTED # EXISTS FORA CERTAIN LISTING.    THERE IS ALSO A DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE FOR DEAF PEOPLE WHO USETELETYPEWRITERS IF YOU MODEM CAN TRANSFER BAUDOT (THE APPLE CAT CAN), THEN YOUCAN CALL HER UP AND HAVE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH HER.  THE #IS:800/855-1155. SHE USES THE STANDARD TELEX ABBREVIATIONS SUCH AS GA FOR GOAHEAD. THEY TEND TO BE NICER & WILL TALK LONGER THAN YOUR REGULAR OPERATORS.ALSO, THEY ARE MORE VULNERABLE INTO BEING TALKED OUT OF INFORMATION THROUGH THEPROCESS OF "SOCIAL ENGINEERING" AS CHESHIRE CATALYST WOULD PUT IT.OTHER OPERATORS HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR OWN DA BY DIALING KP+NPA+131+ST (MF).    THIS IS A LITTLE OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THIS TUTORIAL, BUT MANY TELCO'S ARENOW CHARGING FOR CALLS TO DIR. ASST. YOU CAN BEAT THIS BY:(1) COUNT HOW MANY CALLS YOU MAKE TO DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE IN A BILLING PERIOD.GO TO A FORTRESS FONE & DIAL DA.  WHEN THE OPERATOR COMES ON, GIVE HER A NAMETHAT YOU KNOW HAS AN UNLISTED # OR ASK FOR A TOWN THAT ISN'T IN THE NPA.  SHEWILL THEN ASK FOR YOUR # SO SHE CAN CREDIT THE CALL TO YOU. GIVE HER YOUR HOME#, SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE MAKING A FREE CALL FROM THE FORTRESS. JUSTMAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T CREDIT YOURSELF FOR MORE CALLS THAN YOU ACTUALLY MADEOR YOU MIGHT HAVE A FEW PROBLEMS!(2) IF YOU HAVE A BAUDOT TERMINAL, USE THE 800 #, IT'S FREE & THERE IS ONE #FOR ALL REQUESTS.C/NA OPERATORS:____________________________________________________________    C/NA OPERATORS ARE OPERATORS THAT DO EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT DIRECTORYASSISTANCE OPERATORS ARE FOR.  SEE PART II, FOR MORE INFO ON C/NA & #'S.  IN MYEXPERIENCES, THESE OPERATORS KNOW MORE THAN THE DA OP'S DO & THEY ARE MORESUSCEPTIBLE TO "SOCIAL ENGINEERING."  IT IS POSSIBLE TO BULLSHIT A C/NAOPERATOR FOR THE NON-PUB DA # (IE, YOU GIVE THEM THE NAME & THEY GIVE YOU THEANOTHER IN THE NETWORK.    PROBLEMS WITH AN OPERATOR?  ASK TO SPEAK TO THEIR SUPERVISOR... WHICH ISTHE EQUIVALENT OF THE MADAME IN A WHOREHOUSE (IF YOU WILL EXCUSE THE ANALOGY).    BY THE WAY, SOME CO'S THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DIAL A 1 OR 0 AS THE 4THDIGIT, WILL ALSO ALLOW YOU TO CALL SPECIAL OPERATORS WITHOUT A BLUE BOX.  THISIS VERY RARE THOUGH!  FOR EXAMPLE, 212-121-1111 WILL GET YOU A NY INWARDOPERATOR.OFFICE HIERARCHY<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>    EVERY SWITCHING OFFICE OFFICE IN NORTH AMERICA (THE NPA SYSTEM), ISASSIGNED AN OFFICE NAME & CLASS.  THERE ARE FIVE CLASSES OF OFFICES NUMBERED 1THROUGH 5.  YOUR CO IS MOST LIKELY A CLASS 5 OR END OFFICE. ALL LONG-DISTANCE(TOLL) CALLS ARE SWITCHED BY A TOLL OFFICE WHICH CAN BE A CLASS 4, 3, 2, OR 1OFFICE.  THERE IS ALSO A 4X OFFICE CALLED AN INTERMEDIATE POINT.  THE 4X OFFICEIS A DIGITAL ONE THAT CAN HAVE AN UNATTENDED EXCHANGE ATTACHED TO IT (KNOWN ASA REMOTE SWITCHING UNIT-RSU).    THE FOLLOWING CHART WILL LIST THE OFFICE #, NAME, & HOW MANY OF THOSEOFFICES EXISTED IN NORTH AMERICA IN 1981.CLASS       NAME       ABB  # EXISTING----- ---------------- --- ------------1   REGIONAL CENTER  RC         122   SECTIONAL CENTER SC         673   PRIMARY CENTER   PC        2304   TOLL CENTER      TC       1,304P  TOLL POINT       TP          ?4X  INTERMEDIATE PT  IP          ?5   END OFFICE       EO     19,000R   RSU              RSU         ?    WHEN CONNECTING A CALL FROM ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER, THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENTUSUALLY TRIES TO FIND THE SHORTEST ROUTE BETWEEN THE CLASS 5 END OFFICE OF THECALLER & THE CLASS 5 END OFFICE OF THE CALLED PARTY. IF NO INTER-OFFICE TRUNKSEXIST BETWEEN THE 2 PARTIES, IT WILL THEN MOVE UPTO THE NEXT HIGHEST OFFICE FORSERVICING (CLASS 4).  IF THE CLASS 4 OFFICE CANNOT HANDLE THE CALL BY SENDINGIT TO ANOTHER CLASS 4 OR 5 OFFICE, IT WILL BE SENT TO THE NEXT OFFICE IN THEHIERARCHY (3). THE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT FIRST USES THE HIGH-USAGE INTEROFFICETRUNK GROUPS, IF THEY ARE BUSY IT THEN GOES TO THE FINAL TRUNK GROUPS ON THENEXT HIGHEST LEVEL. IF THE CALL CANNOT BE CONNECTED THEN, YOU WILL PROBABLY GETA RE-ORDER (120IPM BUSY SIGNAL) SIGNAL.  AT THIS TIME, THE GUYS AT NETWORKOPERATIONS ARE PROBABLY SHITTING IN THEIR PANTS AND TRYING TO AVOID THE DREADEDNETWORK DREADLOCK (AS SEEN ON TV!).                                    Page 108                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT 9 CONNECTIONS IN TANDEM IS CALLEDRING-AROUND-THE ROSY AND IT HAS NEVER OCCURRED IN TELEPHONE HISTORY.

THEY AREKNOWN AS:  STEP, CROSSBAR, & ESS.STEP-BY-STEP (SXS)____________________________________________________________    THE STEP-BY-STEP, A/K/A THE STROWGER SWITCH OR TWO-MOTION SWITCH, WASINVENTED IN 1889 BY AN UNDERTAKER NAMED ALMON STROWGER.  HE INVENTED THISMECHANICAL SWITCHING EQUIPMENT BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THE BIASED OPERATOR WASROUTING ALL REQUESTS FOR AN 'UNDERTAKER' TO HER HUSBAND'S BUSINESS. BELLSTARTED USING THIS SYSTEM IN 1918 AS OF 1978, OVER 53% OF THE BELL EXCHANGESUSED THIS METHOD OF SWITCHING.    STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING IS CONTROLLED DIRECTLY BY THE DIAL PULSES WHICH MOVEA SERIES OF SWITCHES (CALLED THE SWITCH TRAIN) IN ORDER. WHEN YOU FIRST PICK UPTHE FONE UNDER SXS, A LINEFINDER ACKNOWLEDGES THE REQUEST (SOONER OR LATER) BYSENDING A DIAL TONE.  IF YOU THEN DIALED 1234, THE EQUIPMENT WOULD FIRST FINDAN IDLE SELECTOR SWITCH.  IT WOULD THEN MOVE VERTICALLY 1 PULSE, IT WOULD THENMOVE HORIZONTALLY TO FIND A FREE SECOND SELECTOR, IT WOULD THEN MOVE 2 VERTICALPULSES, STEP HORIZONTALLY TO FIND THE NEXT SELECTOR, ETC.  THUS THE FIRSTSWITCH IN THE TRAIN TAKES NO DIGITS, THE SECOND SWITCH TAKES 1 DIGIT, THE THIRDSWITCH TAKES 1 DIGIT, & THE LAST SWITCH IN THE TRAIN (CALLED THE CONNECTOR)TAKES THE LAST 2 DIGITS & CONNECTS YOUR CALLS. A NORMAL (10,000 LINE) EXCHANGEREQUIRES 4 DIGITS (0000-9999) TO CONNECT A LOCAL CALL & THUS IT TAKES 4SWITCHES TO CONNECT EVERY CALL (LINEFINDER, 1ST & 2ND SELECTORS, & THECONNECTOR) .    WHILE IT WAS THE FIRST, SXS SUCKS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:[1] THE SWITCHED OFTEN BECOME JAMMED THUS THE CALLS OFTEN BECOME BLOCKED.[2] YOU CAN'T USE DTMF (DUAL-TONE MULTI-FREQUENCY A/K/A TOUCH-TONE) DIRECTLY.IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TELCO MAY HAVE INSTALLED A CONVERSION KIT BUT THEN THECALLS WILL GO THROUGH JUST AS SLOW AS PULSE, ANYWAY![3] THEY USE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY & MECHANICAL MAINTENANCE. (BAD FROM TELCOPOINT OF VIEW)[4] EVERYTHING IS HARDWIRED.    THEY CAN STILL HOOK UP PEN REGISTERS & OTHER SHIT ON THE LINE SO IT IS NOTEXACTLY A PHREAK HAVEN.YOU CAN IDENTIFY SXS OFFICES BY:(1) LACK OF DTMF OR PULSING DIGITS AFTER DIALING DTMF.(2) IF YOU GO NEAR THE CO, IT WILL SOUND LIKE A TYPEWRITER TESTING FACTORY.(3) LACK OF SPEED CALLING, CALL FORWARDING, & OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICES.(4) FORTRESS FONES THAT WANT YOUR MONEY FIRST (AS OPPOSED TO DIAL TONE FIRSTONES).    THE PRECEDING DON'T NECESSARILY IMPLY THAT YOU HAVE SXS BUT THEY SURELY                                    Page 110                        The Official Phreaker's ManualGIVE EVIDENCE THAT IT MIGHT BE.  ALSO, IF ANY OF THE ABOVE CHARACTERISTICSEXIST, IT CERTAINLY ISN'T ESS!  ALSO, SXS HAVE PRETTY MUCH BEEN ERADICATED FROMLARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS NYC (212).CROSSBAR:____________________________________________________________    THERE ARE 3 MAJOR TYPES OF CROSSBAR SYSTEMS CALLED:  NO. 1 CROSSBAR (1XB),NO. 4 CROSSBAR (4XB), & NO. 5 CROSSBAR (5XB).  5XB HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY ENDOFFICE SWITCH OF BELL SINCE THE 60'S AND THUS IT IS IN WIDE-USE.    CROSSBAR USES A COMMON CONTROL SWITCHING METHOD.  WHEN THERE IS AN INCOMINGCALL, A STORED PROGRAM DETERMINES ITS ROUTE THROUGH THE SWITCHING MATRIX.POINT WHERE THESE 2 LINES MEET IN THE MATRIX IS THE CONNECTION.ESS____________________________________________________________ELECTRONIC SWITCHING SYSTEM (ESS) THE PHREAK'S NIGHTMARE COME TRUE (OR ORWELL'SPROPHECY AS 2600 PUTS IT)    ESS IS BELL'S MOVE TOWARDS THE AIRSTRIP ONE SOCIETY DEPICTED IN ORWELL'S1984. WITH ESS, EVERY SINGLE DIGIT THAT YOU DIAL IS RECORDED--EVEN IF IT IS AMISTAKE.  THEY KNOW WHO YOU CALL, WHEN YOU CALL, HOW LONG YOU TALKED FOR, &PROBABLY WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT (IN SOME CASES).  ESS CAN (AND IS) ALSOPROGRAMMED TO PRINT OUT #'S OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE EXCESSIVE CALLS TO 800 #'S ORDIRECTORY ASSISTANCE. THIS IS CALLED THE "800 EXCEPTIONAL CALLING REPORT." ESSCOULD ALSO BE PROGRAMMED TO PRINT OUT LOGS OF WHO CALLS CERTAIN #'S--LIKE ABOOKIE, A KNOWN COMMUNIST, A BBS, ETC THE THING TO REMEMBER WITH ESS IS THAT ITIS A SERIES OF PROGRAMS WORKING TOGETHER.  THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE VERY EASILYCHANGED TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IT TO DO.  ONE PHREAK WHOM I KNOW HAS SOME ESSSOURCE CODE LISTING WHICH IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX (AS WELL AS DOCUMENTED--GRACIASDIOS).  THIS SYSTEM MAKES THE JOB OF BELL SECURITY, THE FBI, NSA, & OTHERORGANIZATIONS THAT LIKE TO INVADE PRIVACY INCREDIBLY EASY.    WITH ESS, TRACING IS DONE IN MICROSECONDS (EINE AUGENBLICK) & THE RESULTSARE PRINTED AT THE CONSOLE OF A BELL GESTAPO OFFICER.  ESS WILL ALSO PICK UPANY "FOREIGN" TONES ON THE LINE SUCH AS 2600 HZ!    BELL PREDICTS THAT THE COUNTRY WILL BECOME TOTALLY ESS BY THE 1990'S.    YOU CAN IDENTIFY ESS BY THE FOLLOWING WHICH ARE USUALLY ESS FUNCTIONS:[1] DIALING 911 FOR HELP.[2] DIAL-TONE-FIRST FORTRESSES.[3] CUSTOM CALLING SERVICES SUCH AS:CALL FORWARDING, SPEED DIALING, & CALLWAITING.  (ASK YOUR BUSINESS OFFICE IF YOU CAN GET THESE.)[4] ANI (AUTOMATIC NUMBER IDENTIFICATION) ON LD CALLS.    PHREAKING DOES NOT COME TO A COMPLETE HALT UNDER ESS THOUGH--JUST BE VERY    DUE TO THE FACT THAT ESS SENDS A COMPUTER GENERATED "ARTIFICIAL RING,"WHERE THE VOICE IS NOT CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE CALLED PARTIES LINE UNTIL HE                                    Page 111                        The Official Phreaker's ManualPICKS UP, BLACK BOXES & INFINITY TRANSMITTERS WILL NOT WORK!NOTE: ANOTHER INTERESTING WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT YOU ARE ON ISTO RAID THE TRASH CAN OF YOU LOCAL CO--THIS ART WILL DISCUSSED IN A SEPARATEARTICLE SOON.COMING SOON:<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>IN THE PART V, WE WILL START TO TAKE A LOOK AT TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS.FURTHER READING:FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE ABOVE TOPICS, I SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING:NOTES ON THE NETWORK, AT&T, 1980.UNDERSTANDING TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS, 1983.AND SUBSCRIPTIONS TO:TAP, ROOM 603, 147 W 42 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10036.

PART V WILL DEAL WITH TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS FOCUSINGPRIMARILY ON THE SUBSCRIBER'S TELEPHONE. HERE-IN-AFTER SIMPLY REFERRED TO AS"FONE."WIRING:____________________________________________________________    ASSUMING A STANDARD ONE-LINE FONE, THERE ARE USUALLY 4 WIRES THAT LEAD OUTOF THE FONE SET.  THESE ARE STANDARDLY COLORED RED, GREEN, YELLOW, & BLACK.THE RED & GREEN SIRES ARE THE TWO THAT ARE ACTUALLY HOOKED UP TO YOUR CO.  THEYELLOW WIRE IS SOMETIMES USED TO RING DIFFERENT FONES ON A PARTY LINE (IE, ONE#, SEVERAL FAMILIES--FOUND PRIMARILY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THEY PAY LESS FOR THESERVICE AND THEY DON'T USE THE FONE AS MUCH); OTHERWISE, THE YELLOW IS USUALLYJUST IGNORED. ON SOME TWO-LINE FONES, THE RED & GREEN WIRES ARE USED FOR THEFIRST FONE # AND THE YELLOW & BLACK ARE USED FOR THE SECOND LINE. IN THIS CASE    IN TELEPHONY, THE RED & GREEN WIRES ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS TIP (T) & RING(R).  THE TIP IS USUALLY THE MORE POSITIVE OF THE TWO WIRES.  THIS NAMING GOESBACK TO THE OLD OPERATOR CORD BOARDS WHERE ONE OF THE WIRES WAS THE TIP OF THEPLUG AND THE OTHER WAS THE RING (OF THE BARREL).    A ROTARY FONE (AKA DIAL OR PULSE) WILL WORK FINE REGARDLESS WHETHER THE RED(OR GREEN) WIRE IS CONNECTED THE TIP(+) OR RING(-).  A TOUCH-TONE (TM) FONE ISA DIFFERENT STORY, THOUGH.  IT WILL NOT WORK EXCEPT IF THE TIP(+) IS THE GREENWIRE. [ALTHOUGH, SOME OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE DTMF FONES DO HAVE A RECTIFIERBRIDGE WHICH COMPENSATES FOR POLARITY REVERSAL.]  THIS I WHY UNDER CERTAIN(NON-DIGITAL) SWITCHING EQUIPMENT YOU CAN REVERSE THE RED & GREEN WIRES ON ATOUCH-TONE FONE AND RECEIVE FREE DTMF SERVICE.  EVEN THOUGH IT WON'T BREAK DIALTONE, REVERSING THE WIRES ON A ROTARY LINE ON A DIGITAL SWITCH WILL CAUSE THETONES TO BE GENERATED.VOLTAGES, ETC.____________________________________________________________    WHEN YOUR TELEPHONE IS ON-HOOK (IE, HUNG UP) THERE IS APPROXIMATELY 48VOLTS OF DC CURRENT (VDC) FLOWING THROUGH THE TIP & RING.  WHEN THE HANDSET OFA FONE IS LIFTED A FEW SWITCHES CLOSE WHICH CAUSE A LOOP TO BE CONNECTED (KNOWNAS THE "LOCAL LOOP") BETWEEN YOUR FONE & THE CO.  ONCE THIS HAPPENS DC CURRENTIS ABLE TO FLOW THROUGH THE FONE WITH LESS RESISTANCE. THIS CAUSES A RELAY TOENERGIZE WHICH CAUSES OTHER CO EQUIPMENT TO REALIZE THAT YOU WANT SERVICE.EVENTUALLY, YOU SHOULD END UP WITH A DIAL TONE.  THIS ALSO CAUSES THE 48 VDC TODROP DOWN INTO THE VICINITY OF 13 VOLTS.  THE RESISTANCE OF THE LOOP ALSO DROPSBELOW THE 2500 OHM LEVEL.                                    Page 113                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    AS OF NOW, YOU ARE PROBABLY SAYING TO YOURSELF THAT THIS IS ALL NICE ANDTECHNICAL BUT WHAT THE HELL GOOD IS THE INFORMATION.  WELL, ALSO CONSIDER THATTHIS VOLTAGE (& RESISTANCE) DROP IS HOW THE CO DETECTS THAT A FONE WAS TAKENOFF HOOK (PICKED UP).  IN THIS WAY, THEY KNOW WHEN TO START BILLING THE CALLINGNUMBER.  NOW WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WOULD HAPPEN IF A DEVICE SUCH AS A RESISTOR ORA ZENER DIODE WAS PLACED ON THE CALLED PARTIES LINE SO THAT THE VOLTAGE WOULDDROP JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW TALKING BUT NOT ENOUGH TO START BILLING?  FIRST OFF,THE CALLING PARTY WOULD NOT BE BILLED FOR THE CALL BUT CONVERSATION COULD BEPURSUED. SECONDLY, THE CO EQUIPMENT WOULD THINK THAT THE FONE JUST KEPT ONRINGING. THE TELCO CALLS THIS A "NO-NO" (TOLL FRAUD TO BE MORE SPECIFIC) WHILEPHONE PHREAKS AFFECTIONATELY CALL THIS MUTE A BLACK BOX.    THE FOLLOWING ARE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO BUILD A SIMPLE BLACK BOX. OFCOURSE, ANYTHING THAT PREVENTS THE VOLTAGE FROM DROPPING WOULD WORK.YOU ONE OR TWO PARTS:      A SPST TOGGLE SWITCH AND A 10,000 OHM (10 K), 1/2WATT RESISTOR.  ANY ELECTRONICS STORE SHOULD STOCK THESE PARTS.    NOW, CUT 2 PIECES OF WIRE (ABOUT 6 INCHES LONG) AND ATTACH ONE END OF EACHWIRE TO ONE OF THE TERMINALS ON THE SWITCH.  NOW TURN YOUR K500 (STANDARD DESKFONE) UPSIDE DOWN AND TAKE OFF THE COVER.  LOCATE THE 2 SCREWS ON THE NETWORKBOX LABELED >F< AND >RR<.  WRAP THE RESISTOR BETWEEN THE 2 SCREWS MAKING SURETHAT IT DOESN'T TOUCH ANY OTHER TERMINALS!.  NOW CONNECT ONE WIRE FROM THESWITCH TO THE RR TERMINAL. FINALLY, ATTACH THE REMAINING WIRE TO THE GREEN WIRE(DISCONNECT IT FROM ITS TERMINAL).  NOW BRING THE SWITCH OUT THE REAR OF THEFONE AND REPLACE THE COVER.    PUT THE SWITCH IN A POSITION WHERE YOU RECEIVE A DIAL TONE.  MARK THISPOSITION NORMAL.  MARK THE OTHER SIDE FREE.    WHEN YOUR PHRIENDS CALL (AT A PREARRANGED TIME), QUICKLY LIFT & DROP THERECEIVER AS FAST A POSSIBLE.  THIS WILL STOP THE RINGING (DO IT AGAIN IF ITDOESN'T) WITH OUT STARTING THE BILLING.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO IT QUICKLY(LESS THAN ONE SECOND THEN PUT THE SWITCH IN THE FREE POSITION AND PICK UP THEFONE.  KEEP ALL CALL SHORT AND PREFERABLY UNDER 15 MINUTES.NOTE:      IF ANYONE PICKS UP AN EXTENSION IN THE CALLED PARTIES HOUSE AND THATFONE IS NOT SET FOR FREE THEN BILLING WILL START.NOTE:      AN OLD WAY OF SIGNALING A PHRIEND THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO CALL ISMAKING A COLLECT CALL TO A NON-EXISTENT PERSON IN THE HOUSE.  SINCE YOUR FRIENDWILL NOT ACCEPT THE CHARGES, HE WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO CALL AND THUSPREPARE THE BLACK BOX    (OR VISA VERSA).WARNING:     THE TELCO CAN DETECT BLACK BOXES IF THEY SUSPECT ONE ON YOUR LINE.THIS IS DONE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF AC VOICE SIGNAL AT THE WRONG DC LEVEL!PICTORIAL DIAGRAM: (STANDARD ROTARY K500 FONE)____________________________________________________________ _____________________________________|                                     |***BLUE WIRE**>>F<                    ||            *   *                    |**WHITE WIRE**   *                    ||                *                    ||            RESISTOR                 ||                *                    |                                    Page 114                        The Official Phreaker's Manual|                *                    ||              >RR<*******SWITCH****  ||                                  *  |****GREEN WIRE**********************  ||                                     ||_____________________________________|NOTE:      THE BLACK BOX WILL NOT WORK UNDER ESS OR OTHER SIMILAR DIGITALSWITCHES SINCE ESS DOES NOT CONNECT THE VOICE CIRCUITS UNTIL THE FONE IS PICKEDUP (& BILLING STARTS).  INSTEAD, ESS USES AN "ARTIFICIAL"   COMPUTER GENERATEDRING.RINGING:____________________________________________________________    TO INFORM A SUBSCRIBER OF AN INCOMING CALL, THE TELCO SENDS 90 VOLTS (RMS)OF AC CURRENT DOWN THE LINE (AT AROUND 15 TO 60 HZ)  IN STANDARD FONES, THISCAUSES A METAL ARMATURE TO BE ATTRACTED ALTERNATELY BETWEEN TWO ELECTRO-MAGNETSTHUS STRIKING 2 BELLS.  OF COURSE, THE STANDARD BELL (PATENTED IN 1878 BY TOMA. WATSON) CAN BE REPLACED BY A MORE MODERN ELECTRONIC BELL OR SIGNALINGDEVICE.    ALSO, YOU CAN HAVE LIGHTS AND OTHER SIMILAR DEVICES IN LIEU OF (OR INCONJUNCTION WITH) THE BELL.  A SIMPLE NEON LIGHT (WITH ITS CORRESPONDINGRESISTOR) CAN SIMPLY BE CONNECTED BETWEEN THE RED & GREEN WIRES (USUALLY L1 &L2 ON THE NETWORK BOX) SO THAT IT LIGHTS UP ON INCOMING CALLS.  A REGULAR 60WATT LIGHT BULB CAN ALSO BE HOOKED UP USING A SIMPLE (120 VAC) RELAY.WARNING:      90 & 120 VAC CAN GIVE QUITE A SHOCK.  EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION IFYOU WISH TO FURTHER PURSUE THESE TOPICS.    ALSO INCLUDED IN THE RINGING CIRCUIT IS A CAPACITOR TO PREVENT THE DCCURRENT FROM INTERFERING WITH THE BELL [A CAPACITOR WILL PASS AC CURRENT WHILEIT WILL PREVENT DC CURRENT FROM FLOWING (BY STORING IT)].    ANOTHER REASON THAT THE TELCO HATES BLACK BOXES IS BECAUSE RINGING USESALOT OF COMMON-CONTROL EQUIPMENT, IN THE CO, WHICH USE ALOT OF ELECTRICITY.THUS THE RINGING GENERATORS ARE BEING TIED UP WHILE A FREE CALL IS BEING MADE.USUALLY CALLS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO RING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME MAY BECONSTRUED AS SUSPICIOUS.  SOME OFFICES MAY BE SET UP TO DROP A TROUBLE CARD FORLONG PERIODS OF RINGING THEN A "NO-NO" DETECTION DEVICE MAY BE PLACED ON THELINE.    INCIDENTALLY, THE TERM "RING TRIP" REFERS TO THE CO PROCESS INVOLVED TOSTOP THE AC RINGING SIGNAL WHEN THE CALLING FONE GOES OFF HOOK.NOTE:      IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU ACTUALLY DISSECT FONES TO HELP YOU BETTERUNDERSTAND THEM. IT WILL ALSO HELP YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS HEREIF YOU ACTUALLY PROVE THEM TO YOURSELF.  FOR EXAMPLE, ACTUALLY TAKE THE VOLTAGEREADINGS ON YOUR FONE LINE [ANY SIMPLE MULTI-TESTER (A MUST) WILL DO.]PHREAKING IS AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS NOT A PASSIVE ONE!DIALING:____________________________________________________________    ON A STANDARD FONE, THERE ARE TWO COMMON TYPES OF DIALING:  PULSE & DTMF.OF COURSE, SOME PEOPLE INSIST UPON BEING DIFFERENT AND DON'T USE THE DT THUSLEAVING THEM WITH MF (MULTI FREQUENCY, AKA OPERATOR, BLUE BOX) TONES.  THIS ISANOTHER "NO-NO" AND THE TELCO SECURITY GENTLEMEN HAVE A SPECIAL KNACK FORDEALING WITH SUCH "PHREAKS" ON THE NETWORK.                                    Page 115                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    WHEN YOU DIAL ROTARY, YOU ARE ACTUALLY RAPIDLY BREAKING & RECONNECTING(MAKING) THE LOCAL LOOP ONCE FOR EVERY DIGIT DIALED. SINCE THE PHYSICALCONNECTION MUST BE BROKEN, YOU CANNOT DIAL IF ANOTHER EXTENSION (OF THAT #) ISOFF-HOOK.  NEITHER OF THE FONES WILL BE ABLE TO DIAL PULSE UNLESS THE OTHERHANGS UP.    ANOTHER TERM OFTEN REFERRED TO IN TELEPHONE ELECTRONICS IS THE BREAK RATIO.IN THE US, THERE ARE 10 PULSES PER SECOND (MAX).  WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS OPENED ITIS CALLED THE BREAK INTERVAL. WHEN IT IS CLOSED IT IS CALLED THE MAKE INTERVAL.IN THE US, THERE IS A 60 MILLISECOND (MS) BREAK PERIOD AND A 40 MS MAKE PERIOD.(60+40=100 MS = 1/10 MINUTE).  THIS IS REFERRED TO AS A 60% BREAK INTERVAL.SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED ELECTRONIC FONES CAN SWITCH BETWEEN A 60% & A67% BREAK INTERVAL.  THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT MANY FOREIGN NATIONS USE A67% BREAK INTERVAL.    HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN AN OFFICE OR A SIMILAR FACILITY AND SAW A FONEWAITING TO BE USED FOR A FREE CALL BUT SOME ASSHOLE PUT A LOCK ON IT TO PREVENTOUTGOING CALLS?    WELL, DON'T FRET PHELLOW PHREAKS, YOU CAN SIMULATE PULSE DIALING BY RAPIDLYDEPRESSING THE SWITCHOOK.  (IF YOU DEPRESS IT FOR LONGER THAN A SECOND IT WILLBE CONSTRUED AS A DISCONNECT.)  BY RAPIDLY SWITCHOOKING YOU ARE CAUSING THELOCAL LOOP TO BE BROKEN & MADE SIMILAR TO ROTARY DIALING!  THUS IF YOU CANMANAGE TO SWITCHOOK RAPIDLY 10 TIMES YOU CAN REACH AN OPERATOR TO PLACE ANYCALL YOU WANT! THIS TAKES ALOT OF PRACTICE, THOUGH.  YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRACTICEON YOUR OWN FONE DIALING A FRIEND'S # OR SOMETHING ELSE. INCIDENTALLY, THISMETHOD WILL ALSO WORK WITH DTMF FONES SINCE ALL DTMF LINES CAN ALSO HANDLEROTARY.    ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH PULSE DIALING IS THAT IT PRODUCES HIGH-VOLTAGE SPIKESTHAT MAKE LOUD NOISES IN THE EARPIECE AND CAUSE THE BELL TO "TINKLE."  IF YOUNEVER NOTICED THIS THEN YOUR FONE HAS A SPECIAL "ANTI-TINKLE" & EARPIECESHORTING CIRCUIT (MOST DO).  IF YOU HAVE EVER DISSECTED A ROTARY FONE (A MUSTFOR ANY SERIOUS PHREAK) YOU WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE 2 SETS OF CONTACTTHAT OPEN AND CLOSE DURING PULSING (ON THE BACK OF THE ROTARY DIAL UNDER THEPLASTIC COVER).  ONE OF THESE ACTUALLY OPENS ANDCLOSES THE LOOP WHILE THE OTHER MUTES THE EARPIECE BY SHORTING IT OUT. THESECOND CONTACTS ALSO ACTIVATES A SPECIAL ANTI-TINKLE CIRCUIT THAT PUTS A 340OHM RESISTOR ACROSS THE RINGING CIRCUIT WHICH PREVENTS THE HIGH VOLTAGE SPIKESFROM INTERFERING WITH THE BELL.    DUAL TONE MULTI FREQUENCY (DTMF) IS A MODERN DAY IMPROVEMENT ON PULSEDIALING IN SEVERAL WAYS.  FIRST OF ALL, IT IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE USERSINCE IT IS FASTER AND CAN BE USED FOR SIGNALING AFTER THE CALL IS COMPLETED(IE, SCC'S, COMPUTERS, ETC.).  ALSO, IT IS MORE UPTO PAR WITH MODERN DAYSWITCHING EQUIPMENT (SUCH AS ESS) SINCE PULSE DIALING WAS DESIGNED TO ACTUALLYMOVE RELAYS BY THE NUMBER OF DIGITS DIALED (IN SXS OFFICES).    EACH KEY ON A DTMF KEYPAD PRODUCES 2 FREQUENCIES SIMULTANEOUSLY (ONE FROMTHE HIGH GROUP AND ANOTHER FROM THE LOW GROUP).           _______________________________________________LOW GROUP |           |           |           |           |   697 HZ-|     Q     |    ABC    |    DEF    |           |          |     1     |     2     |     3     |     A     |          |___________|___________|___________|___________|          |           |           |           |           |   770 HZ-|    GHI    |    JKL    |    MNO    |           |          |     1     |     2     |     3     |     B     |          |___________|___________|___________|___________|          |           |           |           |           |   852 HZ-|    PRS    |    TUV    |    WXY    |           |          |     1     |     2     |     3     |     C     |                                    Page 116                        The Official Phreaker's Manual          |___________|___________|___________|___________|          |           | OPERATOR  |           |           |   941 HZ-|           |     Z     |           |           |          |     *     |     0     |     #     |     D     |          |___________|___________|___________|___________|                |           |           |           |             1209 HZ     1336 HZ     1477 HZ     1633 HZ               HIGH GROUPA PORTABLE DTMF KEYPAD IS KNOWN AS A WHITE BOX.    THE FOURTH COLUMN (1633 HZ) IS NOT NORMALLY FOUND ON REGULAR FONES BUT ITDOES HAVE SEVERAL SPECIAL USES.  FOR ONE, IT IS USED TO DESIGNATE THE PRIORITYOF CALLS ON AUTOVON, THE MILITARY FONE NETWORK. THESE KEY ARE CALLED:  FLASH,IMMEDIATE, PRIORITY, & ROUTINE (WITH VARIATIONS) INSTEAD OF ABCD.  SECONDLY,THESE KEYS ARE USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES BY THE TELCO.  IN SOME AREA YOU CANFIND LOOPS AS WELL AS OTHER NEAT TESTS (SEE PART II) ON THE 555-1212 DIRECTORYASSISTANCE EXCHANGE. FOR THIS, YOU WOULD CALL UP AN DA IN CERTAIN AREAS [THATHAVE AN AUTOMATIC CALL DISTRIBUTOR (ACD)] AND HOLD DOWN THE "D" KEY WHICHSHOULD BLOW THE OPERATOR OFF.  YOU WILL THEN HEAR A PULSING DIAL TONE WHICHINDICATES THAT YOU ARE IN THE ACD INTERNAL TESTING MODE.  YOU CAN GET ON ONESIDE OF A LOOP BY DIALING A 6.  THE OTHER SIDE IS 7.  SOME PHREAKS CLAIM THATIF THE PERSON ON SIDE 6 HANGS UP, OCCASIONALLY THE EQUIPMENT WILL SCREW UP ADSTART DIRECTING DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE CALLS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOOP.ANOTHER ALLEGED TEST IS CALLED REMOB WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TAP INTO LINES BYENTERING A SPECIAL CODE FOLLOWED BY THE 7 DIGIT NUMBER YOU WANT TO MONITOR.THEN THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF MASS CONFERENCING.    ACD'S ARE BECOME RARE THOUGH.  YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE SEVERALNPA-555- 1212 CALLS BEFORE YOU FIND ONE.    YOU CAN MODIFY REGULAR FONES QUITE READILY SO THAT THEY HAVE A SWITCH TOCHANGE BETWEEN THE 3RD AND 4TH COLUMNS. THIS IS CALLED A SILVER BOX (AKA GREYBOX) AD PLANS CAN BE FOUND IN TAP AS WELL AS ON MANY BBS'S.TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER:____________________________________________________________    WHEN YOU TALK INTO THE TRANSMITTER, THE SOUND WAVES FROM YOUR VOICE CAUSE ADIAPHRAGM TO VIBRATE AND PRESS AGAINST THE CARBON GRANULES (OR ANOTHER SIMILARSUBSTANCE).  THIS CAUSES THE CARBON GRANULES TO COMPRESS AND CONTRACT THUSCHANGING THE RESISTANCE OF THE DC CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH IT.  THEREFORE, YOURAC VOICE SIGNAL IS SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE DC CURRENT OF THE LOCAL LOOP. THERECEIVER WORKS IN A SIMILAR FASHION WHERE THE SIMPLE TYPES UTILIZE A MAGNET,ARMATURE, & DIAPHRAGM.HYBRID/INDUCTION COIL:____________________________________________________________    AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, THERE ARE TWO WIRES FOR THE RECEIVER AND TWO FORTHE TRANSMITTER IN THE FONE, YET THE LOCAL LOOP CONSISTS OF 2 WIRES INSTEAD OF4. THIS 4-WIRE TO 2-WIRE CONVERSION IS DONE INSIDE THE FONE BY A DEVICE KNOWNAS AN INDUCTION COIL WHICH USES COUPLING TRANSFORMERS.    THE REASON 2 SIRES ARE USED ON THE LOCAL LOOPS ARE BECAUSE IT IS ALOTCHEAPER FOR THE TELCO.  ALTHOUGH, ALL OF THE INTER-OFFICE TRUNKS UTILIZE 4WIRES.  THIS IS NECESSARY FOR FULL DUPLEX (IE, SIMULTANEOUS CONVERSATION ONBOTH SIDES) AND FOR AMPLIFICATION DEVICES.  THERE ARE SIMILAR DEVICES IN THECO'S, KNOWN AS A HYBRID, THAT COUPLE THE 4-WIRE TRUNKS TO THE 2-WIRE LOCALLOOPS AND VISA-VERSA.                                    Page 117                        The Official Phreaker's ManualMISCELLANEOUS:____________________________________________________________    IN THE TELEPHONE, THERE IS ALSO A BALANCING NETWORK CONSISTING OF A FEWCAPACITORS & RESISTORS WHICH PROVIDE SIDETONE.  SIDETONE ALLOWS THE CALLER TOHEAR HIS OWN VOLUME IN THE RECEIVER. HE CAN THEN ADJUST HIS VOICE ACCORDINGLY.THIS PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM SHOUTING OR SPEAKING TOO SOFTLY WITHOUT NOTICING IT.HOLD:____________________________________________________________    WHEN A TELEPHONE GOES OFF HOOK, THE RESISTANCE DROPS BELOW 2500 OHMS.  ATTHIS POINT, THE TELCO WILL SEND A DIAL TONE.  TO PUT SOMEONE ON HOLD YOU MUSTPUT A 1000 OHM RESISTOR (1 WATT) ACROSS THE TIP & RING BEFORE IT REACHES THESWITCHOOK.  IN THIS WAY, WHEN THE FONE IS HUNG UP (FOR HOLD) THE RESISTANCEREMAINS BELOW 2500 OHMS WHICH CAUSES THE CO TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE STILLOFF-HOOK.  YOU CAN BUILD A SIMPLE HOLD DEVICE USING THE FOLLOWING PICTORIALDIAGRAM:(RED) O_________________________ [L1]      |             |      |           |             |      |       1000 OHM          |      X           |             |       X       RESISTOR       RINGING   |           |          CIRCUIT   |  -SWITCH           |             |      |     HOOK           /             |      |          / SPST SWITCH  |      X           |             |       X           |             |      |           |             |      |(GREEN) O__|_____________|______|  [L2]--> TO REST OF FONECONCLUSION:____________________________________________________________NOTE:     MANY OF THE ELECTRONICS COMPONENTS OF NORMAL FONES  (K500) AREENCLOSED IN THE NETWORK BOX (WHICH SHOULDN'T BE OPENED).    I HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE READER HAS A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF ELECTRONICS.

The first obstacle for a slug is the magnetic trap.  This willstop any light-weight magnetic slugs and coins. If it passes this, the slug isthen classified as a nickel, dime, or quarter.  Each slug is then checked forappropriate size and weight. If these tests are passed, it will then travelthrough a nickel, dime, or quarter magnet as appropriate.  These magnets set upan eddy current effect which causes coins of the appropriate characteristics toslow down so they will follow the correct trajectory.  If all goes well, thecoin will follow the correct path (such as bouncing off of the nickel anvil)where it will hopefully fall into the narrow accepted coin channel.    The rather elaborate tests that are performed as the coin travels down thecoin chute will stop most slugs and other undesirable coins, such as pennies,which must then be retrieved using the coin release lever.    If the slug miraculously survives the gamut, it will then strike theappropriate totalizer arm causing a ratchet wheel to rotate once for every5-cent increment (eg, a quarter will cause it to rotate 5 times).    The totalizer then causes the coin signal oscillator to readout adual-frequency signal indicating the value deposited to ACTS (a computer) orthe TSPS operator. These are the same tones used by phreaks in the infamous redboxes.    For a quarter, 5 beep tones are outpulsed at 12-17 pulses per second (PPS).A dime causes 2 beep tones at 5 - 8.5 PPS while a nickel causes one beep toneat 5 - 8.5 PPS.  A beep consists of 2 tones:  2200 + 1700 Hz.    A relay in the fortress called the "B relay" (yes, there is also an 'Arelay') places a capacitor across the speech circuit during totalizer read-outto prevent the "customer" from hearing the red box tones.    In older 3 slot phones:  one bell (1050-1100 Hz) for a nickel, two bellsfor a dime, and one gong (800 Hz) for a quarter are used instead of the moderndual-frequency tones.TSPS & ACTS____________________________________________________________                                    Page 120                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    While fortresses are connected to the CO of the area, all transactions arehandled via the Traffic Service Position System (TSPS).  In areas that do nothave ACTS, all calls that require operator assistance, such as calling card andcollect, are automatically routed to a TSPS operator position.    In an effort to automate fortress service, a computer system known asAutomated Coin Toll Service (ACTS) has been implemented in many areas.  ACTSlistens to the red box signals from the fones and takes appropriate action.  Itis ACTS which says, "Two dollars please (pause) Please deposit two dollars forthe next ten seconds" (and other variations). Also, if you talk for more thanthree minutes and then hang-up, ACTS will call back and demand your money.ACTS is also responsible for Automated Calling Card Service.    ACTS also provide trouble diagnosis for craftspeople (repairmenspecializing in fortresses).  For example, there is a coin test which is greatfor tuning up red boxes.  In many areas this test can be activated by dialing09591230 at a fortress (thanks to Karl Marx for this information).  Onceactivated it will request that you deposit various coins. It will then identifythe coin and outpulse the appropriate red box signal.  The coins are usuallyreturned when you hang up.    To make sure that there is actually money in the fone, the CO initiates a"ground test" at various times to determine if a coin is actually in the fone.This is why you must deposit at least a nickel in order to use a red box!Green Boxes:____________________________________________________________    Paying the initial rate in order to use a red box (on certain fortresses)left a sour taste in many red boxer's mouths thus the GREEN BOX was invented.The green box generates useful tones such as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, andRINGBACK.  These are the tones that ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to theCO when appropriate. Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at a fortressstation but it must be used by the CALLED party.Here are the tones:COIN COLLECT       700 + 1100 HzCOIN RETURN       1100 + 1700 HzRINGBACK           700 + 1700 Hz    Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator releasedsignal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO. This can beaccomplished by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or a single 2600 Hz wink (90 ms) followedby a 60 ms gap and then the appropriate signal for at least 900 ms.    Also, do not forget that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3minute period is up.    Incidentally, once the above MF tones for collecting and returning coinsreach the CO, they are converted into an appropriate DC pulse (-130 volts forreturn & +130 volts for collect). This pulse is then sent down the tip to thefortress.  This causes the coin relay to either return or collect the coins.    The alleged "T-Network" takes advantage of this information.  When a pulsefor COIN COLLECT (+130 VDC) is sent down the line, it must be groundedsomewhere.  This is usually either the yellow or black wire. Thus, if the wiresare exposed, these wires can be cut to prevent the pulse from being grounded.When the three minute initial period is almost up, make sure that the black &yellow wires are severed; then hang up, wait about 15 seconds in case of asecond pulse, reconnect the wires, pick up the fone, hang up again, and if allgoes well it should be "JACKPOT" time.                                    Page 121                        The Official Phreaker's ManualPhysical Attack:____________________________________________________________    A typical fortress weighs roughly 50 lbs. with an empty coin box. Most ofthis is accounted for in the armor plating.  Why all the security?  Well, Bellcontributes it to the following:        "Social changes during the 1960's made the multislot coin station aprime target for:  vandalism, strong arm robbery, fraud, and theft of service.This brought about the introduction of the more rugged single slot coin stationand a new environment for coin service."As for picking the lock, I will quote Mr. Phelps:        "We often fantasize about 'picking the lock' or 'getting a masterkey.'  Well, you can forget about it. I don't like to discourage people, but itwill save you from wasting alot of your time--time which can be put to betteruse (heh, heh)."    As for physical attack, the coin plate is secured on all four side byhardened steel bolts which pass through two slots each.  These bolts are inturn interlocked by the main lock.    One phreak I know did manage to take one of the 'mothers' home (which wasattached to a piece of plywood at a construction site; otherwise, the permanentones are a bitch to detach from the wall!). It took him almost ten hours toopen the coin box using a power drill, sledge hammers, and crow bars (which wasempty -- perhaps next time, he will deposit a coin first to hear if it slushesdown nicely or hits the empty bottom with a clunk.)    Taking the fone offers a higher margin of success.  Although this may bedifficult often requiring brute force and there has been several cases of backaxles being lost trying to take down a fone!  A quick and dirty way to open thecoin box is by using a shotgun.  In Detroit, after ecologists cleaned out amunicipal pond, they found 168 coin phones rifled.    In colder areas, such as Canada, some shrewd people tape up the fones usingduct tape, pour in water, and come back the next day when the water will havefroze thus expanding and cracking the fone open.In one case:        "unauthorized coin collectors" where caught when they brought $6,000 inchange to a bank and the bank became suspicious...    At any rate, the main lock is an eight level tumbler located on the rightside of the coin box.  This lock has 390,625 possible positions (5 ^ 8, sincethere are 8 tumblers each with 5 possible positions) thus it is highly pickresistant!  The lock is held in place by 4 screws.  If there is sufficientclearance to the right of the fone, it is conceivable to punch out the screwsusing the drilling pattern below (provided by Alexander Mundy in TAP)                                    Page 122                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                                   Chapter 5   What is covered in these last few articles, is the essence of phreaking,blue boxing & equal access.

Often they will come across references such as "simply dial KP+ 2130801050 + ST for the Alliance teleconferencing system in LA.". Numberssuch as the one above were intended to be used with a blue box; this articlewill explain the fundamental principles of the fine art of blue boxing.Genesis:____________________________________________________________    In the beginning, all long distance calls were connected manually byoperators who passed on the called number verbally to other operators inseries.  This is because pulse (aka rotary) digits are created by causingbreaks in the DC current (see Basic Telcom V). Since long distance callsrequire routing through various switching equipment and AC voice amplifiers,pulse dialing cannot be used to send the destination number to the end localoffice (CO).    Eventually, the demand for faster and more efficient long distance (LD)service caused Bell to make a multi-billion dollar decision. They had to createa signaling system that could be used on the LD Network. Basically, they hadtwo options:[1]     To send all the signaling and supervisory information (ie, ON & OFFHOOK) over separate data links.  This type of signaling is referred to asout-of-band signaling.                           -or-[2]      To send all the signaling information along with the conversationusing tones to represent digits.  This type of signaling is referred to asin-band signaling.    Being the cheap bastard that they naturally are, Bell chose the latter (andcheaper) method -- IN-BAND signaling.  They eventually regretted this, though(heh, heh)...IN-BAND SIGNALING PRINCIPLES:____________________________________________________________    When a subscriber dials a telephone number, whether in rotary or touch-tone(aka DTMF), the equipment in the CO interprets the digits and looks for aconvenient trunk line to send the call on its way.  In the case of a localcall, it will probably be sent via an inter-office trunk; otherwise, it will besent to a toll office (class 4 or higher -- see Telcom IV) to be processed.    When trunks are not being used there is a 2600 Hz tone on the line; thus,to find a free trunk, the CO equipment simply checks for the presence of 2600Hz. If it doesn't find a free trunk the customer will receive a re-order signal                                    Page 124                        The Official Phreaker's Manual(120 IPM busy signal) or the "all circuits are busy..." message.   If it doesfind a free trunk it "seizes" it -- removing the 2600 Hz.  It then sends thecalled number or a special routing code to the other end or toll office.    The tones it uses to send this information are called multi-frequency (MF)tones.  An MF tone consists of two tones from a set of six master tones whichare combined to produce 12 separate tones.  You can sometimes hear these tonesin the background when you make a call but they are usually filtered out soyour delicate ears cannot hear them. These are NOT the same as touch-tones.    To notify the equipment at the far end of the trunk that it is about toreceive routing information, the originating end first sends a Key Pulse (KP)tone.  At the end of sending the digits, #he originating end then sends a STart(ST) tone. Thus to call 914-359-1517, the equipment would send KP + 9143591517+ ST in MF tones.  When the customer hangs up, 2600 Hz is once again sent tosignify a disconnect to the distant end.History:____________________________________________________________    In the November 1960 issue of The Bell System Technical Journal, an articleentitled "Signaling Systems for Control of Telephone Switching" was published.This journal, which was sent to most university libraries, happened to containthe actual MF tones used in signaling.  They appeared as follows:Digit                Tones-----                -----  1              700 +  900 Hz  2              700 + 1100 Hz  3              900 + 1100 Hz  4              700 + 1300 Hz  5              900 + 1300 Hz  6             1100 + 1300 Hz  7              700 + 1500 Hz  8              900 + 1500 Hz  9             1100 + 1500 Hz  0             1300 + 1500 Hz  KP            1100 + 1700 Hz  ST            1500 + 1700 Hz  11  (*)        700 + 1700 Hz  12  (*)        900 + 1700 Hz  KP2 (*)       1300 + 1700 Hz(*)  Used only on CCITT SYSTEM 5 for special international calling.    Bell caught wind of blue boxing in 1961 when it caught a Washington statecollege student using one.  They originally found out about blue boxes throughpolice raids and informants. In 1964, Bell Labs came up with scanningequipment, which recorded all suspicious calls, to detect blue box usage.These units were installed in CO's where major toll fraud existed. AT&TSecurity would then listen to the tapes to see if any toll fraud was actuallycommitted.  Over 200 convictions resulted from the project. Surprisinglyenough, blue boxing is not solely limited to the electronics enthusiast; AT&Thas caught businessmen, film stars, doctors, lawyers, college students, highschool students and even a millionaire financier (Bernard Cornfeld) using thedevice.  AT&T also said that nearly half of those that they catch arebusinessmen.                                    Page 125                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    Of course, phone phreaks have achieved an almost cult status. They havealso had their fair share of media.  In October 1971, Esquire published theinfamous "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" article which featured phreaks suchas Captain Crunch, who took his name from the cereal which one gave awaywhistles that produced a perfect 2600 Hz pitch; Joe Engressia, the blindphreak; and Mark Bernay, one of the nation's first and oldest phreaks. Otherssuch as Apple computer co-founders Steve Wozniak & Steve Jobs have also hadblue box backgrounds. 1971 also saw the publication of the first issue of YIPL,the phone phreak newsletter, (now TAP) under the editorship of supreme yippieAbbie Hoffman.Usage:____________________________________________________________    To use a blue box, one would usually make a free call to any 800 number ordistant directory assistance (NPA-555-1212).  This, of course, is legitimate.When the call is answered, one would then swiftly press the button that wouldsend 2600 Hz down the line.  This has the effect of making the distant COequipment think that the call was terminated and it leaves the trunk hanging.Now, the user has about 10 seconds to enter in the telephone number he wishedto dial -- in MF, that is.  The CO equipment merely assumes that this came fromanother office and it will happily process the call. Since there are no records(except on toll fraud detection devices!) of these MF tones, the user is notbilled for the call.  When the user hangs up, the CO equipment simply recordsthat he hung up on a free call.Detection:____________________________________________________________    Bell has had 20 years to work on detection devices; therefore, in this dayand age, they are rather well refined.  Basically, the detection device willlook for the presence of 2600 Hz where it does not belong.  It then records thecalling number and all activity after the 2600 Hz.  If you happen to be at afortress fone, though, and you make the call short, your chances of gettingcaught are significantly reduced (see Telcom VI). Incidentally, there have beenrumors of certain test numbers (see Telcom II) that hook directly into trunksthus avoiding the need for 2600 Hz and detection!    Another way that Bell catches boxers is to examine the CAMA (CentralizedAutomatic Message Accounting) tapes. When you make a call, your number, thecalled number, and time of day are all recorded.  The same thing happens whenyou hang up.  This tape is then processed for billing purposes. Normally, allfree calls are ignored. But Bell can program the billing equipment to make noteof lengthy calls to directory assistance.  They can then put a pen register(aka DNR) on the line or an actual full-blown tap.  This detection can beavoided by making short-haul (aka local) calls to box off of.    It is interesting to note that NPA+555-1212 originally did not returnanswer supervision.  Thus the calls were not recorded on the AMA/CAMA tapes.AT&T changed this though for "traffic studies!"CCIS:____________________________________________________________    Besides detection devices, Bell has begun to gradually redesign the networkusing out-of-band signaling.  This is known as Common Channel Inter-officeSignaling (CCIS).  Since this signaling method sends all the signalinginformation over separate data lines, blue boxing is impossible under it.                                    Page 126                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    While being implemented gradually, this multi-billion dollar project isstill strangling the fine art of blue boxing. Of course until the project istotally complete, boxing will still be possible. It will become progressivelyharder to find places to box off of, though.  In areas with CCIS, one must finda directory assistance office that doesn't have CCIS yet.  Area codes in Canadaand predominately rural states are the best bets.  WATS numbers terminating innon-CCIS cities are also good prospects.Pink Noise:____________________________________________________________    Another way that may help to avoid  detection is too add some "pink noise"to the 2600 Hz tone. Since 2600 Hz tones can be simulated in speech, thedetection equipment must be careful not to misinterpret speech as a disconnectsignal.  Thus a virtually pure 2600 Hz tone is required for disconnect.    Keeping this in mind, the 2600 Hz detection equipment is also probablylooking for pure 2600 Hz or else is would be triggered every time someone hitthat note (highest E on a piano =2637 Hz).  This is also the reason that the2600 Hz tone must be sent rapidly; sometimes, it won't work when the  operatoris saying "Hello, hello."  It is feasible to send some "pink noise" along withthe 2600 Hz.  Most of this energy should be above 3000 Hz.  The pink noisewon't make it into the toll network (where we want our pure 2600 Hz to hit) butit should make it past the local CO and thus the fraud detectors.Construction:____________________________________________________________    While step-by-step details for the construction of a blue box is beyond thescope of this tutorial, it is worthwhile to mention some of the details.    First there are some alternatives but they are not as good as an actualblue box.  Many computers are capable of generating MF tones. Thus, your localphriendly software pirate should have a program compatible for your computer.    However, it is highly advisable not to box from home as stated in The TenCommandments (as interpreted for phreaks by Fred Steinbeck -- TAP #86).I.     Box thou not over thine home telephone wires, for those who doest mustsurely bring the full wrath of the Chief Special Agent down upon thy heads.    Another alternative that has a moderate success rate involves recording thetones from a phriend with a box or computer onto a cassette tape.  They canthen be used at a fortress.    As for actual construction techniques, TAP has devoted many issues to blueboxing.  Basically, a blue box is merely a device capable of generating twodifferent tones simultaneously. There are two basic construction methods that Iwill outline below for the electronics hobbyist.    The first involves the use of two 555 timer chips (or a 556 -- i.e., two555's in one chip).  It offers excellent frequency and voltage stability.Also, it does not need a diode matrix keypad but used double-pole switchesinstead.  Schematics for this type of box can be found in TAP issue #29.    The other common box makes use of two Intersil 8038CC Function Generators.It does require a diode matrix keypad though, potentiometers, an LM-100 voltage                                    Page 127                        The Official Phreaker's Manualregulator, a 741 Op-amp, and a handful of other parts.  The schematics for thistype of blue box can be found in TAP #26. Both designs draw about 20 ma ofcurrent.    Also, most blue boxes use telephone earpieces (with the varistor removed)for speakers.  These can be easily liberated from fortress fones with a smallcoping saw.    Usually, the hardest part about building a blue box is the calibration. Afrequency counter is a must and an oscilloscope won't hurt.    Some boxes also take timing into account.  It is feasible on the ESSsystems that they check to see if the digits are of uniform length.  If theyaren't, they are probably from a blue box and a trouble card may be dropped.With this in mind, the Bell standard for MF pulses and interdigit intervals isaround 75 ms.  It varies with the equipment used since ESS can handle higherspeeds and doesn't need interdigit intervals.Applications:____________________________________________________________    Besides dialing normal calls free, i.e., KP+NPA+NNX+XXXX+ST, blue boxesoffer the entire network for exploration.  Emergency break-ins, servicemonitoring (aka taps), stacking tandems (the art of busying out all trunksbetween two points), re-routing calls, conference calls, and much, much more... Inward Operator City Codes         Usually, the INWARD operator for an area is simply KP + NPA + 121 +ST.  In some area codes, though, there are several large cities and thus                                    Page 128                        The Official Phreaker's Manualseveral inwards.  To find the inward for a specific city, you would say "916756, operator route, please" to the R&R operator who will then tell you "916plus 001 plus."  This means that KP+ 916 + 001 + 121 + ST will get you aninward for Sacramento, CA (916-756).... City names         If you want to know the city that corresponds to an area code andexchange, you simply tell the R&R, "Place name, 914 390, please." In thisexample, the R&R operator will respond with "White Plains, NY."... International Directory Assistance         If you need a directory route for London, you could say"International, London, England.  TSPS directory route, please."  The R&Roperator will respond with "Directory to London, England. Country code 44 plus1 plus 986 plus 3611." Therefore to get a DA operator in London, you wouldroute yourself to an international sender and KP + 04419863611 + ST.... Country & City codes         If you need to know the country and city code for an internationalnumber you can say "International, Sydney, Australia, TSPS numbers route,please" and get "Country code 61 plus 2."... International Inwards Routes         To get routing codes for international inwards say "International,London, England, TSPS inward route, please." The R&R Operator will respond with"Country code 44 plus 121."    Finally, to get language assistance for completing a foreign call you cantell the foreign inward, "United States calling.  Language assistance incompleting a call to (called party) at (called number)."151      --  Overseas incoming (212 +& 914+)160-XX0  --  Various Overseas Operators161      --  Trouble reporting operator (defunct)181      --  Coin Refund Operator18X      --  Overseas senders    To make an international call, one would KP + 011 + 0CC + ST where CC isthe country code.  This will route you to the appropriate overseas sender. Youwill then receive a 480 Hz dial tone.  Here you enter KP + 0CC + city code +local number + ST and the call is on its way.    Country codes can be either 1, 2, or 3 digits but they must be padded forthree digits to create a pseudo-country code with extra zero's if necessary.For example, England, country code 44, becomes 044.    To see which international sender a certain country (lets use FrenchGuiana, country code 594, for example) goes through, you can dial KP + 011 +594 + ST, wait for the Proceed to Send tone then KP + 000 + 0000 + ST and youwill receive a recording saying which ISC (International Switching Center) itis.  For the example it will say, "This is the international switching centerin Pittsburg, PA -- This is a recording - 4121."  You can actually route callsto certain senders yourself (KP + NPA + 18X + ST) but it is better off not tosince it may look suspicious if a call is sent through a sender that it                                    Page 129                        The Official Phreaker's Manualshouldn't go through.  Here are the senders:182  -- White Plains, NY183  -- New York, NY184  -- Pittsburg, PA185  -- Orlando, FL186  -- Oakland, CA187  -- Denver, CO188  -- New York, NY    Also, there tends to be alot of talk about the Code 11, Code 12, KP2, STP,ST3P, & ST2P keys.  While they do exist the blue boxer need not concern himselfwith them.  The first three are used on CCITT System 5.  This is the signalingsystem that the International Senders use to send information to othercountries.  These codes are usually added automatically just like the languageassistance digit [which distinguishes operator (or blue box) dialed calls fromcustomer dialed calls].  The STP, ST3P, & ST2P tones are used when equipment iscommunicating with the TSPS.  These also are automatically added when needed inmost cases.[see Telcom III for more on International Switching Centers (ISC)]11XXX   -- miscellaneous operators11501   -- universal cordboard operator11511   -- conference operator11521   -- mobile operator11531   -- marine operator11541   -- LD incoming switchboard11551   -- leave word for time & charges (neat stuff)11561   -- same as 11551 but for hotel/motels11571   -- overseas operators (language assistance)    The 11XXX series is interesting scanning material.Miscellaneous Routing Codes :____________________________________________________________    Alliance Teleconferencing has several numbers, a few of which are listedbelow:KP + 213 080 XXXX + STKP + 305 025 XXXX + STKP + 312 001 XXXX + STXXXX = 1050, 1100, or a few others    Also, at KP + 317 009 + ST there is a MF tone checker.

Begin scanningthree digit codes in your area (i.e., KP + 000 + ST, KP + 001 + ST, etc.). Keeptrack of all of your results. Sometimes you must probe things, send additionaldigits and see what happens, send touch-tone, send it 2600 Hz, rip it apart.You never know, you may run into something phun, like a computer that checks CCnumbers.                                    Page 130                        The Official Phreaker's Manual    Incidentally, in some exchange you can dial inwards and other box codesdirectly!  For example, 914-121-1111 will get you a NY inward. The only problemis that a 0 or 1 as the first digit of the exchange is usually *prohibited incustomer dialing. Somebody may have "accidentally" changed this screening codeon your ESS's computer, though -- you never know and it can't hurt to try.WATS translation numbers also take up some of the 0XX & 1XX codes.    Finally, certain tones on the blue box can also be used for other purposes.An MF "2" corresponds to COIN COLLECT while "KP" corresponds to COIN RETURN.Thus every blue box is also a green box (see Telcom VI).Coming soon:Telcom VIII will deal with cordless phones, mobile phones, and other neatthings.Be careful and have phun,*****BIOC*=$=*Agent*****003                                    Page 131                        The Official Phreaker's ManualThe Mark Tabas encounter series presents:         -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=                         Better Homes and Blue Boxing                                    Part I                              Theory of Operation         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  To quote Karl Marx, blue boxing has always been the most noble form ofphreaking. As opposed to such things as using an MCI code to make a free fonecall, which is merely mindless pseudo-phreaking, blue boxing is actualinteraction with the Bell System toll network. It is likewise advisable to bemore cautious when blue boxing, but the careful phreak will not be caught,regardless of what type of switching system he is under.  In this part, I will explain how and why blue boxing works, as well as where.In later parts, I will give more practical information for blue boxing androuting information.  To begin with, blue boxing is simply communicating with trunks. Trunks mustnot be confused with subscriber lines (or "customer loops") which are standardtelefone lines. Trunks are those lines that connect central offices. Now, whentrunks are not in use (i.e., idle or "on-hook" state) they have 2600Hz appliedto them. If they are two-way trunks, there is 2600Hz in both directions. When atrunk IS in use (busy or "off-hook" state"), the 2600Hz is removed from theside that is off-hook. The 2600Hz is therefore known as a supervisory signal,because it indicates the status of a trunk; on hook (tone) or off-hook (notone). Note also that 2600Hz denoted SF (single frequency) signalling and is"in-band." This is very important. "In-band" means that is is within the bandof frequencies that may be transmitted over normal telefone lines. Other SFsignals, such as 3700Hz are used also. However, they cannot be carried over thetelefone network normally (they are "out-of-band") and are therefore not ableto be taken advantage of as 2600Hz is.  Back to trunks. Let's take a hypothetical phone call. You pick up your foneand dial 1+806-258-1234 (your good friend in Armarillo, Texas). For ease, we'llassume that you are on #5 Crossbar switching and not in the 806 area. Yourcentral office (CO) would recognize that 806 is a foreign NPA, so it wouldroute the call to the toll centre that serves you. [For the sake of accuracyhere, and for the more experienced readers, note that the CO in question is aclass 5 with LAMA that uses out-of-band SF supervisory signalling]. Dependingon where you are in the country, the call would leave your toll centre (on moretrunks) to another toll centre, or office of higher "rank". Then it would berouted to central office 806-258 eventually and the call would be completed.Illustration:A---CO1-------TC1------TC2----CO2----BA=youCO1=your central officeTC1=your toll office.TC2=toll office in Amarillo.CO2=806-258 central office.B=your friend (806-258-1234)  In this situation it would be realistic to say that CO2 uses SF in-band                                    Page 132                        The Official Phreaker's Manual(2600Hz) signalling, while all the others use out-of-band signalling (3700Hz).If you don't understand this, don't worry too much.  I am pointing this outmerely for the sake of accuracy. The point is that while you are connected to806-258-1234, all those trunks from YOUR central office (CO1) to the 806-258central office (CO2) do *NOT* have 2600Hz on them, indicating to the Bellequipment that a call is in progress and the trunks are in use.  Now let's say you're tired of talking to your friend in Amarillo(806-258-1234) so you send a 2600Hz down the line. This tone travels down theline to your friend's central office (CO2) where it is detected.  However, thatCO thinks that the 2600Hz is originating from Bell equipment, indicating to itthat you've hung up, and thus the trunks are once again idle (with 2600Hzpresent on them). But actually, you have not hung up, you have fooled theequipment at your friend's CO into thinking you have. Thus,it disconnects himand resets the equipment to prepare for the next call. All this happens veryquickly (300-800ms for step-by-step equipment and 150-400ms for otherequipment).  When you stop sending 2600Hz (after about a second), the equipment thinksthat another call is coming towards it (e.g. it thinks the far end has come"off-hook" since the tone has stopped. It could be thought of as a toggleswitch: tone --> on hook, no tone -->off hook. Now that you've stopped sending2600Hz, several things happen:1) A trunk is seized.2) A "wink" is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that theCALLED end (trunk) is not ready to receive digits yet.3) A register is found and attached to the CALLED end of the trunk within abouttwo seconds (max).4) A start-dial signal is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED endindicating that the CALLED end is ready to receive digits.Now, all of this is pretty much transparent to the blue boxer. All he reallyhears when these four things happen is a <beep><kerchunk>. So, seizure of atrunk would go something like this:1> Send a 2600Hz2> Terminate 2600Hz after 1-2 secs.3> [beep][kerchunk]  Once this happens, you are connected to a tandem that is ready to obey yourevery command. The next step is to send signalling information in order toplace your call. For this you must simulate the signalling used by operatorsand automatic toll-dialing equipment for use on trunks. There are mainly twosystems, DP and MF.  However, DP went out with the dinosaur , so I'll onlydiscuss MF signalling. MF (multi-frequency) signalling is the signalling usedby the majority of the inter- and intra-lata network. It is also used ininternational dialing known as the CCITT no.5 system.  MF signalling consists of 7 frequencies, beginning with 700Hz and separatedby 200Hz. A different set of two of the 7 frequencies represent the digits 0thru 9, plus an additional 5 special keys. The frequencies and uses are asfollows:Frequencies (Hz)  Domestic    Int'l                                    Page 133                        The Official Phreaker's Manual-------------------------------------- 700+900             1          1 700+1100            2          2 900+1100            3          3 700+1300            4          4 900+1300            5          51100+1300            6          6 700+1500            7          7 900+1500            8          81100+1500            9          91300+1500            0          0 700+1700           ST3p       Code 11 900+1700           STp        Code 121100+1700           KP         KP11300+1700           ST2p       KP21500+1700           ST         ST  The timing of all the MF signals is a nominal 60ms, except for KP, whichshould have a duration of 100ms. There should also be a 60ms silent periodbetween digits. This is very flexible, however, and most Bell equipment willaccept outrageous timings.  In addition to the standard uses listed above, MF pulsing also has expandedusages known as "expanded inband signalling" that include such things as coincollect, coin return, ringback, operator attached, and operator released. KP2,code 11, and code 12 and the ST_ps (STart "primes") all have special uses whichwill be mentioned only briefly here.  To complete a call using a blue box, once seizure of a trunk has beenaccomplished by sending 2600Hz and pausing for the <beep><kerchunk>, one mustfirst send a KP. This readies the register for the digits that follow.  For astandard domestic call, the KP would be followed by either 7 digits (if thecall were in the same NPA as the seized trunk) or 10 digits (if the call werenot in the same NPA as the seized trunk). [Exactly like dialing a normal fonecall]. Following either the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is sent to signifythat no more digits follow. Example of a complete call:1> Dial 1-806-258-12342> wait for a call-progress indication (such as ring, busy, recording, etc.)3> Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.4> Wait for about 2 seconds while a trunk is seized.5> Send KP+305+994+9966+ST  The call will then connect if every-thing was done properly. Note that if acall to an 806 number were being placed in the same situation, the area codewould be omitted and only KP+ seven digits+ST would be sent.  Code 11 and code 12 are used in international calling to request certaintypes of operators. KP2 is used in international calling to route a call otherthan by way of the normal route, whether for economic or equipment reasons.  STp, ST2p, and ST3p (prime, two prime, and three prime) are used in TSPSsignalling to indicate calling type of call (such as coin-direct dialed).   This has been Part I of Better Homes and Blue Boxing.

Though this can still be done, blue boxing hasessentially outlived its usefulness in this area. Modern day "extenders" andlong distance services provide a safer and easier way to make free fone calls.However, you can do things with a blue box that just can't be done withanything else. For ordinary toll-fraud, a blue box is impractical for thefollowing reasons:1. Clumsy equipment required (blue box or equivalent)2. Most boxed calls must be made through an extender. Not for safety reasons,but for reasons I'll explain later.3. Connections are often sacrificed because considerable distances must bedialed to cross a seizable trunk, in addition to awkward routing.  As stated in reason #2, boxed calls are usually made through an extender.This is for billing reasons. If you recall from Part i, 2600Hz is used as a"supervisory" signal. That is, it signals the status of a trunk--"on-hook" or"off-hook." When you seize a trunk (by briefly sending 2600Hz), your end (theCALLING end) goes on hook for the duration of the 2600Hz and then goes off-hookonce again when the 2600Hz is terminated.  The CALLED end recognizes that acall is on the way and attaches a register, which interprets the digits whichare to be sent. Now, understand that even though your end has come off-hook (no2600Hz present), the other end is still on-hook. You may wonder then, why, ifthe other end (the CALLED end) is still on-hook, there is no 2600Hz coming theother way on the trunk, when there should be. This is correct.  2600Hz *IS*present on the trunk when you seize it and afterwards, but you cannot hear itbecause of a Band Elimination Filter (BEF) at your central office.  Back to the problem. Remember that when you seize a trunk, 2600Hz is indeedcoming the other way on the trunk because the CALLED end is still on-hook, butyou don't actually hear it because of a filter. However, the Bell equipmentknows it's there (they can "hear" it). The presence of the 2600Hz is tellingthe billing equipment that your call has not yet been completed (i.e., theCALLED end is still on-hook). When finally you do connect with your boxed call,the 2600Hz from the called end terminates.  This tells the billing equipmentthat someone picked up the fone at the CALLED end and you should begin to bebilled. So you do start to get billed, but for the call to the trunk, NOT theboxed call. Your billing equipment thinks that you've connected with the numberyou used to seize the trunk. Illustration:1. You call 1+806-258-2222 (directly)2. Status of trunks:<----------------------------------->(You)                    806-258-2222No 2600Hz-------> <------------2600Hz  When you seize a trunk (before the number you called answers) there is no                                    Page 136                        The Official Phreaker's Manualaffect on your billing equipment.  It simply thinks that you're still waitingfor the call to complete (the CALLED end is still on-hook; it is ringing, busy,going to recorder or intercept operator.  Now, let's say that you've seized a trunk (806-258-2222) and for example,KP+314+949+1705+ST. The call is routed from the tandem you seized to:314-949-1705. Illustration:<------------------>O<--------------->(You)              806         314-949    tandemNo 2600Hz----------> <----------2600Hz  Note that the entire path towards the right (the CALLED end) has no 2600Hzpresent and is therefore "off-hook." The entire path towards the left (theCALLING end) does have 2600Hz present on it, indicating that the CALLED end hasnot picked up (or come "off-hook"). When 314-949-1705 answers, "answersupervision" is given and the 2600Hz towards the left (the CALLING end)terminates. This tells your billing equipment, which thinks that you're stillwaiting to be connected with 806-258-2222, that you've finally connected.Billing then begins to 806-258-2222. Not exactly an auspicious beginning for anaspiring young phone phreak.  To avoid this, several actions may be taken. As previously mentioned, one mayavoid being charged for the number called to seize a trunk by using an extender(in which case the extender will get billed). In some areas, boxing may beaccomplished using an 800 number, generally in the format of 800-858-xxxx (manyAmarillo numbers) or 800-NN2-xxxx (special intra-state class in-WATS numbers).However, boxing off of 800 numbers is impossible in many areas. In my area,Denver, I am served by #1A ESS and it is impossible for me to box off of any800 number.  Years ago, in the early days of blue boxing (before my time), phreaks oftenused directory assistance to box off of because they were "free" long distancecalls. However, because of competitive long distance companies, directoryassistance surcharges are now $0.50 in many areas. It is additionally advisedthat directory assistance numbers not be used to box from because of thefollowing:  Average DA calls last under 2 minutes. When you box a call, chances are thatit will last considerably longer. Thus, the Bell billing equipment will make anote of calls to directory assistance that last a long time. A call to adirectory assistant lasting for 4 hours and 17 minutes may appear somewhatsuspicious.  Although the date, time, and length of a DA call do not appear on the bill,it is recorded on AMA tape and will trip a trouble report if it were to lasttoo long. This is how most phreaks were discovered in the old days. Also,sometimes too many calls lasting too long to one 800 number may raise a feweyebrows at the local security office.  Assuming you can complete a blue box call, the following are listed routingsfor various Bell internal operators.  These are in the format of KP+NPA+special routing+1X1+ST, which I will explain later. The 1X1 is the actualoperator routing, and NPA and NPA+ special routing are used for out-of-areacode calls and out-of-area code calls requiring special routing, respectively.KP+101+ST ...... Toll test board.                                    Page 137                        The Official Phreaker's ManualKP+121+ST ...... Inward Operator.KP+131+ST ...... Directory assistance.KP+141+ST ...... was rate & route. Now only works in 312, 815, 717, and a fewothers. It has been replaced with a universal rate & route number800+141+1212.KP+151+ST ...... Overseas completion operator (inbound). Works only in certainNPAs, such as 303.KP+181+ST ...... In some areas, toll station for small towns.  Thus, if you seize a trunk in 806 NPA and wanted an inward (in 806), then youwould dial KP+121+ST. If you wanted a 312 inward and were dialing on an 806trunk, an area code would be required.  Thus, you would dial KP+312+121+ST.Finally, some places in the network require special routing, in addition to anarea code. An example is Franklin Park, Ill. It requires a special routing of032. For this, you would dial KP+312+032+121+ST for a Franklin Park inwardoperator.  Special routings are in the format of 0XX. They are used primarily for loadbalance, so that traffic flow may be evenly distributed. About half of theexchanges in the network require special routing. Note that special routingsare NEVER EVER EVER used to dial normal telephone numbers, only operators.  Operator functions:TOLL TEST BOARD- Generally a cordboard position that assists in trunk testing.They are not used by operators, only switchmen.INWARD- Assists the normal TSPS (0+) operator in completing calls out of theTSPS's area. Also, inwards perform emergency interrupts when the number to beinterrupted is out of the area code of the original (TSPS) operator. Forexample, a 303 operator has a customer that needs an emergency interrupt on215-647-6969. The 303 operator gets the routing for the inward that covers215-647, since she cannot do the interrupt herself. The routing is found to beonly 215+ (no special routing required). So, the 303 operator keysKP+215+121+ST. An inward answers and the 303 says to her, "Inward, this isDenver. I need an emergency interrupt on 215-647-6969. My customer's name isMark Tabas." The inward will then do the interrupt (off the line, of course).If the number to be interrupted had required special routing, such as, say,312-456-1234 (spec routing 032), then the 303 operator would dialKP+312+032+121+ST for the inward to do that interrupt.DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE- These are the normal NPA+555+1212 operators that assistcustomers with obtaining telefone directory listings. Not much toll-fraudpotential here, except maybe $0.50.RATE AND ROUTE-   These operators are reached by dialing KP+800+141+1212+ST.They assist normal (TSPS) operators with rates and routings (thus the name).The only uses I typically have for them are the following: 1. Routing-    Information-    In the above example, when the 303 operator needed to dialan inward that served 215-647, she needed to know if any special routing wasrequired and, if so, what it was. Assuming she would use rate and route, shewould dial them and say nicely, "Operator's route, please, for 215-647." Rate &route would respond with "215 plus."  This means that the operator would dialKP+215+121+ST to reach the inward that serves 215-647.  If there were specialrouting required, such as in 312-456, rate & route would respond with "312 plus032 plus." In that case, the operator would dial KP+312+032+ST for the inward                                    Page 138                        The Official Phreaker's Manualthat serves 312-456.  It is good practice to ask for "operator's route" specifically, as there arealso "numbers route" and "directory routes." If you do not specifically ask foroperator's route, rate & route will generally assume that is what you wantanyway."Numbers"   route refers to overseas calls. Example, you want to know how toreach a number in Geneva, Switzerland (and you already have the number). Youwould call routing and say "Numbers route, please, Geneva, Switzerland." Theoperator would respond with: "Mark 41+22. 011+041+ST (plus) 041+22" The "Mark41+22" has to do with billing, so disregard it. The 011+041 is access to theoverseas gateway (to be discussed in Part iii) and the 041+ 22+ is the routingfor Geneva from the overseas sender."Directory" routings are for directory assistance overseas. Example: you want aDA in Rome, Italy. You would call rate & route and say, "Directory routingplease, for Rome, Italy." They would respond with "011+039+ST (plus) 039+1108STart." As in the previous example, the 011+039 is access to the overseasgateway. The 039+1108 is a directory assistant in Rome. 2. Nameplace information-  Rate & Route will give you the location of an NPA+exchange. Example: "Nameplace please, for 215-648." The operator would respondwith "Paoli, Pennsylvania." This isn't especially useful, since you can get thesame information (legally) by dialing 0, but using rate & route is often muchfaster and it avoids having to hang up when you are already on a trunk.*NOTE*   On Rate & Route: As a blue boxer, always ask for "IOTC" routings.(e.g., "IOTC operator's route", "IOTC numbers route", etc.) This tells themthat you want cordboard-type routings, not TSPS, because a blue boxer isactually just a cordboard position (that Bell doesn't know about).OVERSEAS COMPLETIONOPERATOR (inbound)-  These operators (KP+151+ST) assist in  the completion ofcalls coming in to the United States from overseas. There are KP+151+SToperators only in a few NPAs in the country (namely 303). To use one, you wouldseize a trunk and dial KP+303+151+ST. Then you would tell the operator, forexample, "This is Bangladesh calling. I need U.S.  number 215-561-0562 please."[in a broken Indian accent]. She would connect you, and the bill would be sentto Bangladesh (where I've been billing my KP+151+ST calls for two years).Other internal Bell Operators.KP+11501+ST ...... universal operatorKP+11511+ST ...... conference opKP+11521+ST ...... mobile opKP+11531+ST ...... marine opKP+11541+ST ...... long distance terminalKP+11551+ST ...... time & charges opKP+11561+ST ...... hotel/motel opKP+11571+ST ...... overseas (outbound) op  These 115X1 operators are identical in routing to the 1X1 operators listedpreviously, with one exception. If special routing is required (0XX), then thetrailing 1 is left off.Examples:                                    Page 139                        The Official Phreaker's ManualA 312 universal op ...

Used to time calls and informcustomer of exactly how much it cost.HOTEL/MOTEL- Handles calls to/from hotels and motels.OVERSEASCOMPLETION (outbound)- assists in completion of calls to overseas points. Onlyworks in some, if any NPAs, because overseas assistance has been centralized toIOCC (covered in Part III).  Note that all KP+1X1+ST and KP+115X1+ST operators automatically assume thatyou are a TSPS or cordboard operator assisting a customer with a call. DO NOTDO ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE THIS! If you do not know what to do, don't call theseoperators! Find out what to do first.  This concludes Part II.

There are 7 over-seas gateways in the Bell System, and eachone is designated to serve a certain region of the world. To initiate anoverseas call, one must first access the gateway that the call is to be senton. To do this automatically, decide which country you are calling and find itscountry code.  Then, pad it to the left with zeros as required so it is threedigits. [Add 1, 2, or 3 zeros as required].Examples:Luxembourg (352) is 352 (stays the same)Spain (34)   becomes 034 (1 zero added)U.S.S.R. (7) becomes 007 (2 zeros added)  Next, seize a trunk and dial KP+011+ CC+ST. Note that CC is the three digitpadded country code that you just determined by the above method. [ForLuxembourg, dial KP+011+352+ST, Spain KP+011+034+ST, and the U.S.S.R. KP+011+007+ST]. This is done to route you to the appropriate overseas gateway thathandles the country you are dialing. Even though every gateway will allow youto dial every dialable country, it is good practice to use the gateway that isdesignated for the country you are calling.  After dialing KP+011+CC+ST (as CC is defined above) you should be connectedto an overseas gateway. It will acknowledge by sending a wink (which is audibleas a <beep><kerchink> and a dial tone. Once you receive international dialtone, you may route your call one of two ways: a) as an operator-originatedcall, or b) as a customer-originated call. To go as a operator-originated call,key KP+ country code (NOT padded with zeros)+ city code+number+ST. You willthen be connected, providing the country you are calling can receivedirect-dialed calls. The U.S.S.R. is an example of a country that cannot.Example of a boxed int'l call:To make a call to the Pope (Rome, Italy), first obtain the country code, whichis 39. Pad it with zeros so that it is 039. Seize a trunk and dialKP+011+039+ST. Wait for sender dial tone and then dial KP+39+6+6982+ST.  39 isthe country code, 6 is the city code, and 6982 is the Pope's number in Rome. Togo as an operator-originated call, simply place a zero in front of the countrycode when dialing on the gateway. Thus, KP+0+39+6+6982+ST would be dialed atsender dial tone. Routing your call as operator-originated does not affect muchunless you are dialing an operator in a foreign country                                    Page 141                        The Official Phreaker's Manual  To dial an operator in a foreign country, you must first obtain the operatorrouting from rate & route for that country. Dial rate & route and if you'retrying to get an operator in Yugoslavia, say nicely, "IOTC Operator's route,please, for Yugoslavia." [In larger countries it may be necessary to specify acity].  Rate & route will respond with, "38 plus 11029". So, dial your overseasgateway, KP+011+038+ST, wait for sender dial tone, and key KP+0+38+11029+ST.You should then get an operator in Yugoslavia. Note that you must prefix thecountry code on the sender with a 0 because presumably only an operator herecan dial an operator in a foreign country.  When you dial KP+011+CC+ST for an overseas gateway, it is translated to a3-digit sender code of the format 18X, depending on which sender is designatedto handle the country you are dialing. The overseas gateways and their 3-digitcodes are listed below.182 ..... White Plains, NY183 ..... New York, NY184 ..... Pittsburg, PA185 ..... Orlando, FL186 ..... Oakland, CA187 ..... Denver, CO188 ..... New York, NY  Dialing KP+182+ST would get you the sender in White Plains, and KP+183+STwould get the sender in NYC, etc., but the KP+011+CC+ST is highly suggested (aspreviously mentioned). To find out what sender you were routed to after dialingKP+011+CC+ST, dial (at int'l dial tone): KP+0000000+ST.  If you have difficulty in reaching a sender, call rate and route and ask fora numbers route for the country you're dialing. Sometimes, KP+011+ paddedcountry code+ST will not work.  I have found this in many 3-digit countrycodes. Luxembourg, country code 352, for example, should be KP+011+352+STtheoretically. But it is not. In this case, dial KP+011+ 003+ST for theoverseas gateway. If you have trouble, try dialing KP+00+ first digit ofcountry code+ST, or call rate The IOCC.  Sometimes when you call rate and route and ask for an "IOTC numbers route" or"IOTC operators route" for a foreign country, you will get something like"160+700" (as in the case of the Soviet Union). This means that the country isnot dialable directly and must be handled through the International OverseasCompletion Centre (IOCC). For an IOCC routing, pad the country code to theRIGHT with zeros until it is 3 digits. Then KP+160 is dialed, plus the paddedcountry code, plus ST.  Examples:The U.S.S.R. (7) ...... KP+160+700+STJapan (81) ............ KP+160+810+STUraguay (598) ......... KP+160+598+ST  You will then be routed to the IOCC in Pittsburg, PA, who will ask forcountry, city, and number being dialed.  Many times they will ask for aringback [thanks to Telenet Bob] so have a loop ready. They will then place thecall and call you back (or sometimes put you through directly). Some calls,such as to Moscow, take several hours.The Rate Quote System (RQS).  The RQS is the operator's rate/quote system. It is a computer used by TSPS                                    Page 142                        The Official Phreaker's Manual(0+) operators to get rate and route information without having to dial therate and route operator. In Part ii, I discussed getting an inward routing fordialing-assistance and emergency interrupts from the rate and route operators(KP+800+141+1212+ST). The same information is available from RQS. Say you wantthe inward routing for 305-994. You would seize a trunk and dial KP+009+ST (toaccess the RQS).  Sometimes, if you seize a trunk in an NPA not equipped withRQS, you need to dial an NPA that is equipped with RQS first, such as 303.Anyway, after you dial KP+009+ST or KP+303+009+ST, you will receive a wink(<beep><kerchink>) and then RQS dial tone. At RQS dial tone, for an inwardrouting for 305-994 you would dial KP+06+305+994+ST. That is,KP+06+NPA+exchange+ST. RQS will respond with "305 plus 033 plus". This meansyou would dial KP+305+033+121+ST for an inward that services 305-994.  If nospecial routing were required, RQS would have responded with "305 plus" and youwould simply dial: KP+305+121+ST for an inward.  Another RQS feature is the echo feature. You can use it to test your bluebox. Dial RQS (KP+009+ST) and then key KP+07+1234567890+ST. RQS will respondwith voice identification of the digits it recognized, between the KP+07 andST.  RQS can also be used for rates and directory routings, but those are seldomneeded, so they have been omitted here.Simple Scanning.  If you're interested in scanning, try dialing on a trunk, routings in theformat of KP+11XX1+ST. Begin with 11001 and scan to 11991. There are lots ofinteresting things to be found there, as Doctor Who (413 area) can tell you.Those 11XX1 routings can also be prefixed with an NPA, so if you want to scanarea code 212, dial KP+212+ 11XX1+ST.  There, now you know as much about blue boxing as most phreaks. If you readand understand the material, and put aside preconceived ideas of what blueboxing is that you may have acquired from inexperienced people or otherbulletin boards, you should be well on you way to an enlightening career inblue boxing. If you follow the guidelines in Part I to box, you should have noproblem with the fone company. Comments made by "phreaks" on bulletin boardsthat proclaim "tracing" of blue boxers are nonsense and should be ignored(except for a passing chuckle).NOTE 1: CCIS and the downfall of blue boxing.CCIS stands for Common Channel Inter-office Signalling. It is a signallingmethod used between electronic switching systems that eminiates the use of2600Hz and 3700Hz supervisory signals, and MF pulsing. This is why many placescannot be boxed off of; they employ CCIS, or out-of-band signalling, which willnot respond to any tones that you generate on the line. Eventually, allexisting toll equipment will be upgraded or replaced with CCIS or T-carrier. Inthis case, we'll all be boxing with microwave dishes. Until then (about 1995 bycurrent BOC/AT&T estimates), have fun!If you have ANY questions about this text, please feel free to drop me a line.I will respond to all mail, messages, etc. Insults are also welcomed.

BLUE BOXES, WHILE NOT ALL THAT GREAT FOR MAKING FREECALLS (SINCE THE TPC CAN TELL WHEN THE CALL WAS MADE, AS WELL AS WHERE IT WASTOO AND FROM), ARE REALLY A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY WITH.  SHORT OF BECOMING A REALLIVE TSPS OPERATOR, THEY ARE ABOUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN REALLY PLAY WITH THENETWORK.        FOR THE FEW OF YOU WITH BLUE BOXES, HERE ARE SOME PHRASES WHICH MAYMAKE LIFE EASIER WHEN DEALING WITH THE RATE & ROUTE (R&R) OPERATORS.  TO GETTHE R&R OP, YOU SEND A KP + 141 + ST.  IN SOME AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO PUTANOTHER NPA BEFORE THE 141 (I.E., KP + 213 + 141 + ST), IF YOU HAVE NO LOCALR&R OPS.        THE R&R OPERATOR HAS A MYRIAD OF INFORMATION, AND ALL IT TAKES TO GETTHIS DATA IS MUMBLING CRYPTIC PHRASES.  THERE ARE BASICALLY FOUR SPECIALPHRASES TO GIVE THE R&R OPS.  THEY ARE NUMBERS ROUTE, DIRECTORY ROUTE, OPERATORROUTE, AND PLACE NAME.        YOU GET AN R&R AN AREA CODE FOR A CITY, ONE CAN CALL THE R&R OPERATORAND ASK FOR THE NUMBERS ROUTE.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIND THE AREA CODE FOR CARSONCITY, NEVADA, WE'D ASK THE R&R OP FOR "CARSON CITY, NEVADA, NUMBERS ROUTE,PLEASE." AND GET THE ANSWER, "RIGHT... 702 PLUS." MEANING THAT 702 PLUS 7DIGITS GETS US THERE.        SOMETIMES DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE ISN'T JUST NPA + 131.  THE WAY TO GETTHESE ROUTINGS IS TO CALL R&R AND ASK FOR "ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA, DIRECTORYROUTE, PLEASE." OF COURSE, SHE'D TELL US IT WAS 714 PLUS, WHICH MEANS 714 + 131GETS US THE D.A. OP THERE.  THIS IS SORT OF POINTLESS EXAMPLE, BUT I COULDN'TCOME UP WITH A BETTER ONE ON SHORT NOTICE.        LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW TO GET TO THE INWARD OPERATOR FORSACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA.  THE FIRST SIX DIGITS OF A NUMBER IN THAT CITY WILL BEREQUIRED (THE NPA AND AN NXX).  FOR EXAMPLE, LET US USEM 916 756. WE WOULD CALLR&R, AND WHEN THE OPERATOR ANSWERED, SAY, "916 756, OPERATOR ROUTE, PLEASE."THE OPERATOR WOULD SAY, "916 PLUS 001 PLUS."  THIS MEANS THAT 916 + 001 + 121WILL GET YOU THE INWARD OPERATOR FOR SACRAMENTO.      DO YOU KNOW THE CITY WHICH CORRESPONDS TO 503-640?  THE R&R OPERATORDOES, AND WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS HILLSBORO, OREGON, IF YOU SWEETLY ASK FOR"PLACE NAME, 503 640, PLEASE."        FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU NEED THE DIRECTORY ROUTE FOR SVEG, SWEDEN.SIMPLY CALL R&R, AND ASK FOR, "INTERNATIONAL, BADEN, SWITZERLAND.  TSPSDIRECTORY ROUTE, PLEASE."  IN RESPONSE TO THIS, YOU'D GET, "RIGHT... DIRECTORYTO SVEG, SWEDEN.  COUNTRY CODE 46 PLUS 1170."  SO YOU'D ROUTE YOURSELF TO ANINTERNATIONAL SENDER, AND SEND 46 + 1170 TO GET THE D.A. OPERATOR IN SWEDEN.        INWARD OPERATOR ROUTINGS TO VARIOUS COUNTRIES ARE OBTAINED THE SAME WAY"INTERNATIONAL, LONDON, ENGLAND, TSPS INWARD ROUTE, PLEASE." AND GET "COUNTRYCODE 44 PLUS 121."  THEREFORE, 44 PLUS 121 GETS YOU INWARD FOR LONDON.        INWARDS CAN GET YOU LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK THELANGUAGE. TELL THE FOREIGN INWARD, "UNITED STATES CALLING.  LANGUAGE ASSISTANCEIN COMPLETING A CALL TO (CALLED PARTY) AT (CALLED NUMBER)."        R&R OPERATORS ARE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE TOO, Y'KNOW.  SO ALWAYS BE POLITE,MAKE SURE USE OF 'EM, AND DIAL WITH CARE.NOTE:  AS A RESULT OF THE BREAK-UP, R&R IS NOW KP+800+141+1212+ST                                    Page 145                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                                 Verification                               By Fred Steinbeck>From TAP issue # 88  10-83   There has been a great deal of controversy in the realm of phreakdom over amysterious subject known under a number of different names, including"Verification", "Autoverification", "Verify", "Autoverify", "Verify Busy", andeven "VFY BY".  All of these names basically mean the same thing: the abilityto listen to another person's telephone line from any telephone in thedirect-dialable world.   Needless to say, Bell System is very tight lipped about knowledge regardingverification.  Indeed, the infamous book 'Notes on long distance dialing' ('68edition) says, "Care must be taken to insure that the customer never gainsverification capabilities."  With a printed policy like that, you can imaginewhat their real-world policy is like!  Even their own rate and route operatorswill not give verification on routing codes (at least in my experience), oneeven responding, "What?! You must be crazy! We don't give those out!" Beforeyou get too far into this article, I will state simply: I don't know how toverify. However, I have been fooling with various things related to it, andcollecting information on it for some time now. Therefore, while I can't do it(yet), I may be able to point some other bright TAPer on the right track, andperhaps he or she will show us all how.  If you have knowledge not covered inthis article, but don't want to write an article on your own, please send yourideas, comments, or information to Project Verify, C/O TAP   Verify has alsobeen called "Autoverify", and I have no idea why.  This is not, to myknowledge, a Bell System term (at least I've never seen it in any manuals)  Asfar as I know, there is verify, which means being able to listen to speech(kind of; see below) on a line, and there is the "Emergency Interrupt whichallows you to take part in the conversation taking place on the line inquestion.  It has been suggested that "Autoverify" is the same as an emergencyinterrupt , but I tend to disagree with this idea.  It should be noted that theverification circuitry does not actually let an operator listen to aconversation without making a beep on the line every so often.  Instead, shewill hear encrypted speech.  However, I believe with the proper methods, verifycan be converted to an emergency interrupt.   Verification is normally done either by your normal "0" (TSPS) operator, ifthe call is in your home NPA (HNPA), or by an inward operator (IO).  If thecall is outside your HNPA, your normal operator will call the IO for theNPA,and say, "Verify Busy" or "Emergency Interrupt" please, 555 1212."  The IOwill perform whatever magic he or she must, and then report back.  If the callis in your HNPA, though, the "0" operator can do the verification herself byusing the "VFY BY" key on her keyshelf.  However, in some areas, the operatoruses a routing code to accomplish verification, and this the is loop hole weshall attack.  It follows that if a IO or "0" operator can do it, so can we, with a blue boxNow, courtesy of Robert Allen (who brought it to my attention) and SusanThunder (who apparently discovered it), here is what used to work for gettingoperators to hook you into conversations with other people (i.e.,let you listento them till you hung up): You'd call the operator and say "Operator, TSPSMaintenance Engineer Calling.  Ring forward to 001 + NPA + 7d, ring back to mynumber, hit ring forward, no AMA, and then position release.   This creates some problems, and you must be familiar with the TSPSconsole(by dialing "0"), you are on the "back", or incoming part of a loop.When she places a call for you, the call goes out on the "forward", or outgoingpart of the loop.  If an operator wants to make a call, she punches KP FWD(keypulse forward), the number, and ST. Ring FWD puts a 90 volt ringing signalacross the forward part of the line (and may dial the number as well).  The                                    Page 146                        The Official Phreaker's Manualproblem arises from the fact that I don't know if Ring FWD will actually dial acall, and if there is some other subtle difference between it an KP FWD.   Let us assume ringing forward makes a call from the TSPS console to whatevernumber is given.  Ring back causes your phone to ring (it is assumed you hungup after giving her your instructions; if you didn't you'd hear an annoying 90volts across the earpiece...) "No AMA" means "no automatic message accounting",so nobody gets billed for the call, although it will show up on a tapesomewhere.  "Position Release" removes the operator from the circuit, andallows her to receive other calls.  This leaves an unaccounted-for ringforward.   The verification circuit, as you know, likes to encrypt conversation, whichis something we don't want.  Well, the second Ring FWD sends another  90 voltscrashing against the verify circuitry, which Juda Gerad thinks removes thevoice encryption from the line, puts the operator (and you) in circuit, andputs a beep tone on the line every five seconds.  This seems to make sense, andI am inclined to agree with him.   The bit about "....001 + NPA + 7D" causes the thought "MF routing code" tospring immediately to mind.  Now, the above trick was supposed to work in the213 NPA.  I have tried both "KP+001+213+7D+ST", and some other area codes.  Igenerally get nothing, a reorder signal, or a tandem recording.   Here's some food for thought: On an official Telco sheet I have, labeled "213 NPA MF Routing Codes", 001 is listed as "VFY BY", or verify busy for the213 NPA.  002 is listed for the 805 NPA.  Ma Bell likes to have standardizedrouting codes, such logical, then, that 001 would be a sort of "standard"verify code, and other prefixes would be tacked on at 002,003, etc. However, Ihave heard from a retired operator that verification codes are different fromarea to area, and are not always nice numbers like 001, 002.  Ah, well, a guycan hope, can't he?   Some suggestions for future attacks on this dilemma: Everyone call youroperators and subtly ask questions.  I have found the tend to give informationout easier if you ask for something that you would ordinarily have to be acompany employee to know about, such as rate steps, operator routings, etc.    Casually let slip that you used to be (or still are) an operator, or thatyou work for company security.  Also, you might want to blue box some codeslike 001 followed by your NPA and the last 7D of a busy number.  If you get asort of "whispery noise", try blasting the line with a ringing signal (youmight piggyback another line onto yours and call the piggyback to generate the90 volts) and see if that does anything.                                    Page 147                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                      ===================================                      EQUAL ACCESS AND THE AMERICAN DREAM                      ===================================byMark TabasP.O. Box 620401Littleton, CO 80162July 7, 1985  The American Dream means many things to many people.  To the small, typicalbusinessman, it means building a good, strong business based on hard work andperseverance; indeed, with nothing limiting his potential but he amount of workhe is willing to put into his business.  To a large businessman, the AmericanDream means living and working in a country where a single corporation can havea profit exceeding the gross national product of an entire third world nation.    To the individual, the American Dream is the right to choose -- everythingfrom one's breakfast cereal to a long-distance service, as well as the formalright outlined by our founding fathers: those of life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness.  To the phone phreak, I think the American Dream is, in a sort of twisted way,the uninhibited pursuit of knowledge.  This quest could scarcely remainunchecked in many other countries.  Analogous to this quest is the thriving ofthe Bell System, which until January 1, 1984 consisted of the AmericanTelephone and Telegraph Company, the largest corporation in the history of theworld.  Did the American Dream die on January first or did the divestiture ofAT&T cause a giant step forward for competition and free enterprise in theUnited States?  I do not know.  I do know that the other nations of the worldwere amazed that the United States would dissolve the entity that brought thefinest and most universal telephone system in the world, and did so at a timewhen the majority of the rest of the world was still using two dixie cups and astring.  The unfairness of the situation is that AT&T built the telephone system ofthis nation and is now being bound and gagged and having its possessionsdistributed to others, whom AT&T also wrought.  All in the name of fairness,free competition, and "equal access".  Where was was MCI during the centurythat AT&T built he communications system of this nation?  Well, I believe inEqual Access, Wholly.  And, since I believe in equal access and itsimplications for equality for all so strongly, I feel that MCI, Sprint, andothers should take the same amount of time to build their respective tollnetworks: 100 years. Therefore, if the United States Justice Department weretruly the fair and just administrator that it portrays itself to be, MCI wouldnot have a hand in the long-distance cache until about 2080.  That's onlyfair.  There is no doubt that MCI is a sub-standard organization.  They consist ofincompetent employees, inferior equipment, and an inferior marketing strategy.They are mockingly imitative of AT&T, except in the quality of their service,which is practically unusable.  It is also interesting that with less than 2%market share, MCI calls itself "the nation's long-distance company."  The pointto this diatribe is this.  It's time for these long-distance companies such asMCI and Sprint to grow up.  With Equal Access, they are going to become reallong-distance companies, not the joke organizations they are now, and I thinkit may just take them one hundred years to do so.                                    Page 148                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                                 ============                                 Equal Access                                 ============  Equal Access, as it applies to the telecommunications industry, is "therequirement that each Bell Operating Company provide exchange access to alllong-distance carriers that is equal in type and quality to that provided AT&Tcommunications."  This is the official provision set forth by the United StatesJustice Department in the Modification of the Final Judgment, August 24, 1982.All this means is that each long-distance-distance company will have "equalaccess" to all of the same types of services that AT&T currently enjoys.  Thereare four types of long-distance carrier services, divided into "featuregroups."  They follow.FG A:   "line side access."  This is the standard 7-digit dialup+code (forbilling purposes) +destination telephone number.  It is currently in use bymost long-distance carriers.FG B:   "trunk side access."  These are the 950 exchange numbers. They alsoutilize an authorization code for billing.  As with FG A, automatic     numberidentification (ANI) (i.e. calling number) is not provided to the carrier, butwill be in the future.FG C:   "1+ dialing."  Currently, only AT&T is able to get this type ofservice. It is 1/0+7 of 10 digit direct long distance dialing.  ANI (forbilling) is provided.FG D:    "equal access."  This will allow for 1/0+7 or 10 digit directlong-distance dialing (presubscription carrier) and 10xxx+1/0+7 or 10 digitlong-distance dialing (alternate carrier).  ANI for billing is provided at thelong-distance carrier's option.  Billing may also be handled by the individuallong distance company or the local Bell Operating Company.  Feature groups C and D are mutually exclusive (i.e. both cannot exist in aparticular area at the same time).  Areas which have Feature Group C (AT&Tlong-distance only) are non-Equal Access, and areas which have Feature Group D(multiple long distance carriers) are Equal Access regions.  Feature Group B, the 950 exchange numbers will be used in areas in which itis not feasible to provide with Equal Access, such as step-by-step offices(yes, they CAN have 950 numbers), some crossbar offices, and some independenttelcos, which are not bound by the provisions of Equal Access and may provideto their customers any type of long-distance service(s) they wish.  The 950exchange is now active in many areas.  It is mainly used as a universal"roaming" access port for many long-distance carriers, but when an office isconverted to Equal Access, the 950 capability is removed.  Thus, in an EqualAccess region, one cannot complete a call to a 950 telephone number.  I personally am looking very forward to Equal Access.  My area is notscheduled for full implementation of it until late 1985 or early 1986, and bythis time many of the alternate long distance carriers' networks will be inplace (or well under way).  Think about what Equal Access means.  Equality forall long distance carriers.  Access to common facilities, such as: busy-lineverification lines, Bell System information, signalling specifications. etc.After full implementation of Equal Access, one will be able to take advantageof and manipulate the services of more than just one carrier.  It will nolonger be phreaks vs. AT&T.  When your area is ready to initiate Equal Access, you will receive a noticein the mail informing you of some of the details of Equal Access, and will ask                                    Page 149                        The Official Phreaker's Manualyou to specify your choice of "primary carrier." In some cases you will need tospecify both inter-LATA carrier (IC), which handles calls out of your LATA(Local Access and Transport Area), and an international carrier (INC), whichwill handle calls destined for other countries.  Recent market studies haveshown that between 80 and 90 per cent of residential customers will continue tobe served by AT&T for their long-distance service after Equal Access.  So muchfor competition.  You will probably be faced with many long-distance companies to choose from,including but not limited to: AT&T, MCI, Sprint, ITT, Western Union, Dial U.S.,Call America, TMC, and U.S. Telephone. Whichever you choose will become your"primary carrier."  Your primary carrier will handle your call each time youpick up you fone and dial 1+7 or 10 digits or 0+7 or 10 digits, inter-LATAonly. That is, if you dial a toll call that is within your LATA, it will behandled by your local telephone company (Bell), not by your primary carrier,even though it is a toll call.  Let's use an example.  The state of Coloradoconsists of two LATAs.  For this example, I will use three cities in Colorado:Denver (in LATA1), Sterling (LATA1 also), and Colorado Springs (in LATA2).Note here that even though Denver ad Sterling are in the same LATA, and Denverand Colorado Springs are not, Sterling is actually much farther away fromDenver than Colorado Springs.  This is because LATA boundaries were designedgiving consideration to high toll-traffic regions, to bring in revenue.  Tolltraffic between Denver and Colorado Springs is very high, so the two citieswere placed in separate LATAs (or, more correctly, they were separated by aLATA boundary).  Toll traffic between Denver and Sterling is very low, of thetwo cities were allowed to remain in the same LATA.  Now, if everyone inColorado Springs were to pack up and move to Sterling (though who knows whatthe hell for), the LATA boundaries in Colorado would be changed so that Denverand Sterling were in different LATAs.  The primary factor in determining LATAsis money.  If I made a call to Sterling from my home in Denver, the call would be routedentirely via Mountain Bell long-distance facilities.  No long distance carrierwould be involved because Denver and Sterling are in LATA1.  If I made a callto Kelley, the blonde babe in Colorado Springs, the call would be handled by along distance carrier (in this case, AT&T) because Denver is in LATA1 andColorado Springs is in LATA2.  Here is a table to simplify this:Customer dials          LATA          Carrier-----------------------------------------------------------------7 digits                same          Bell1+7 digits              same          Bell1+7 digits              diff          LD carrier (currently AT&T)1+10 digits             diff          LD carrier (currently AT&T)-----------------------------------------------------------------  Note several things here.  First, not all areas need to dial a 1 when dialingany number, local or long distance, but the central offices will still discernwhether the call is in the same LATA as the customer or a different one andhandle the call appropriately. Secondly, some step-by-step offices require a1+NPA to be dialed for calls within the same LATA and, in fact, all numbersoutside of the office itself.  But, for the most part, the above table isstandard for common switching networks.                              ==================                              Alternate Carriers                              ==================  Your normal long distance carrier will handle all your toll calls which crossover LATA boundaries when you dial directly, 1+.

To access analternate long distance carrier after Equal Access, a customer dials10xxx+1/0+7 or 10 digit telefone number.  Note that xxx is the "carrier accesscode (CAC)."  A few CACs currently in use are listed below.220 ........ Western Union   666 ........ Lexitel222 ........ MCI             777 ........ Sprint333 ........ US Telefone     888 ........ SBS444 ........ Allnet  Thus, in an Equal Access region, to dial Fred in Orlando, a customer woulddial 1+305+994+9966 to place his call on his primary carrier, or to place it onanother network, he could dial: 10222+1+305+994+9966, and the call would goover MCI facilities (in this case).  Eventually, after many more long distanceservices get into the act, there will be a directory of the various longdistance companies and their CACs, and deciding which carrier to use for anyparticular call to get the bet rate will be beyond the ability of everyoneexcept phone phreaks.                               ================                               The 950 Exchange                               ================  As discussed, the 950 central office exchange is currently a "roaming" accessport for various long distance carriers.  In areas that have 950, the access tocarriers is standardized.  Thus, someone travelling to several different areasneed only know the 950 number of the carrier he uses to access it from any area(provided that it have 950 active).  Originally, the 950 exchange was designedto correspond with the 10xx carrier access code used for Equal Access.  Forexample, 950-1022 would be the same carrier as 1022 (+telephone number).However, it was later found that the 100 codes available for use as 10xx CACswould be insufficient to handle he number of long distance carriers.  So, thecommon carrier access code was increased by one digit, to 10xxx, thusincreasing the number of possible CACs to 1000. To keep the 950 exchangeconsistent with the non CAC, the Bell Operating Companies have opted to changethe 950-10xx to 950-0xxx. The xxx in the 950-0xxx remains the same as the xxxin the 10xxx carrier access code.  The new modified 950 numbering pan is nowactive in Philadelphia (Bell Atlantic) among other areas.  After Equal Access is well under way, the 950 exchange will be used incertain areas that cannot be equipped for the standard Equal Access dialingplans.  This includes step-by-step, #1 crossbar, #5 crossbar, #2ESS, and #3ESSoffices.  Customers in areas served by these types of switching equipment willdial 950-0xxx, wait for acknowledgement tone from the carrier, and then dial a"personal identification number" and destination telefone number,and the callwill be completed on the selected carrier's facilities.  Initially, billingwill be handled by the carrier itself, and supervisory information and ANI willnot be provided by the local Bell Operating Company.  There are three main advantages to the 950 central office exchange andprotocol.  They are: a) universal access for all areas, b) 950-exchange numbersare "trunk side access."  This means that the long distance carrier has directtrunks going to it from a Bell toll office or local central office.  Thesetrunks are interoffice lines, not customer type (POTS) lines, and supposedlyinsure higher quality of connection.  And, c) 950-exchange numbers are toll andmessage unit free.  On metered-usage (i.e., not "flat rate") customer lines,they cost nothing.  In most areas they are free from coin stations, withColorado as one notable exception.                                    Page 151                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                                     =====                                     Costs                                     =====  Each long-distance carrier must choose the type(s) of service it wishes toprovide to its customers.  These different types of service were outlinedearlier as "Feature Groups."  The costs of these Feature Groups vary directlywith the complexity and quality of the service itself.  The following tableoutlines the cost to the carrier of each available Feature Group.  It is basedon the monthly rate per line for 9000 minutes of circuit use, and assumes thecarrier and Bell switch are 15 miles apart.FG              non-Equal Access            Equal Access--------------------------------------------------------A                  $329.94                    $709.20B                   329.94                     721.80C                   752.40                    ** N/A **D                  ** N/A **                   752.40--------------------------------------------------------  These figures are a lot more significant than they might appear. Theyindicate that after Equal Access, in order to compete with the giants such asAT&T, MCI, etc., smaller long distance companies will use Feature Group A or Btype service in order to provide significantly lower rates to their customersthan companies subscribing to Feature Group D service (like AT&T, MCI, etc).This will cause a unique type of equilibrium to form.  Customers willing todial an access number, authorization code, and destination number and put upwith lower quality service will be able to save a lot of money. This seemsfaintly reminiscent of pre-Equal Access times....                             ====================                             Directory Assistance                             ====================  Each Bell Operating Company will be responsible for providing intra-LATAoperator services.  When a customer dials (1)+411 or (1)+555+1212 for localdirectory assistance, he will reach a Bell operator who will service requestsfor listed numbers within the customer's LATA.  Requests for numbers in LATAsother than the calling customer's may be handled at the discretion of the localoperating company.  Initially, the Bell Operating Companies will meet theresponsibility for providing directory assistance services by contracting it toa long distance carrier or carriers (currently AT&T).  All inter-LATA directoryassistance services will be provided by the inter-LATA carrier (IC).  ICs mayalso provide 800 Enterprise service or other toll free type directoryassistance services.

But, if youunderstand the concept of LATAs and carriers, it is easily understood.Essentially, all local Bell Operating Companies will maintain their owndirectory assistance services.  When a customer dials 411 or 555-1212, he willreach a BOC directory assistant. Additionally, each long distance carrier thatwishes to provide directory assistance to its customers will also have DAfacilities. And, when a customer dials a directory assistant (NPA+555-1212) ona carrier, he will reach an operator of that particular long distance carrier.The key here is LATAs.  If a customer wants to find a number that is within hisLATA, no long distance carrier is involved.  It is handled strictly by theLocal Bell Operating Company.  If a customer is seeking a number that is notwithin his LATA, he must use the services of an inter-LATA (long-distance)carrier.                            ======================                            TSPS Operator Services                            ======================  Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) operator services will be handled muchin the same fashion as directory assistance services, with a few differences.As with DAs, each Bell Operating Company and each inter-LATA carrier willmaintain its own TSPS operator facilities (or cordboard I suppose, if theycannot afford TSPS).  When a customer dials simply 0 (operator), he will reacha BOC TSPS operator.  The BOC TSPS will be able to handle all types ofintra-LATA operator-assisted traffic including (but not limited to): collect,third party billing, Bell credit card, coin, verification and emergencyinterrupt, and requests for emergency aid.  BOC TSPS will be unable to completecalls for customers outside of the customer's LATA.  Thus, inter-LATA operatorassistance will be handled by an inter-LATA carrier TSPS (IC TSPS).  An IC TSPSwill handle all previously mentioned types of calls that require inter-LATAtransport (i.e., the call originates and terminates in different LATAs).  Whena customer dials 0+NXX-XXXXX or 0+NPA+NXX-XXXX, the central office willdetermine if the call is destined for another LATA.  If it is not, the callwill be sent to the Bell TSPS for appropriate handling.  If the call is boundfor another LATA (and his determination is made based on the NXX or NPA+NXX),then the call will be sent off to the customer's primary long-distance carrier(since only 0+ was dialed).  If the customer wishes to use a differentcarrier's operator services, he would dial 10xxx+0+number, and the carrierspecified by the 10xxx carrier access code would receive the call.  Note: if acustomer dials 10xxx+0+number, and the call is an intra-LATA call, he will geta recording, "We're sorry, the number you dialed cannot be reached with thecarrier access code you dialed.  Please check the code and try again or callyour carrier for assistance."  (Western Electric KS-22550 central office tapelist no. 46.)  Until the Bell Operating Companies can install their own TSPSfacilities and networks, they will (continue to) lease capacity from AT&T TSPS.That is, AT&T will handle the intra-LATA traffic for the BOCs on a contractbasis.  In the meantime, AT&T will continue to handle its own long-distanceoperator services while the other inter-LATA carriers will have to implementtheir own operator networks from scratch.  My estimation is that you won't beable to dial 10222+0 for an MCI TSPS operator until sometime around the year2590.  And even then they will probably be cordboard.  In addition to the changes in TSPS described above, there will be certain                                    Page 153                        The Official Phreaker's Manualmodifications to the software and hardware involved in the TSPS operatorsystem.  Most critical, and of paramount importance to the telecommunicationsenthusiast is changes in circuit associated signalling (CAS).  This issignalling to and from the TSPS facility. When a customer dials 0 (operator) or10xxx+0 (IC operator), a succession of events occurs.  First, the end officeseizes a trunk to the appropriate operator facility (this assumes that noaccess tandem is involved).  The operator service facility responds with a wink(proceed signal) and the end office outpulses the CALLED number (or KP+ST if 0only dialed).  The operator service (OS) facility will then come off-hook tosignal that it is ready to receive ANI information. The end office outpulsesthe ANI information in the format of KP+II+7 digits+ST (or ST').  If there isANI failure, a KP+02+ST (or ST') will be sent.  "ST'" stands for STart "prime",and is indicative of a coin call (i.e., dial 0 from a coin station).  A normalST terminating the ANI sequence means that the call is originating from anoncoin station.  See table for ultimate description.Inter-LATA calls MF-pulsedtype of call       customer dials    cld num          ANI============================================================noncoin:============================================================  direct dialed    10xxx+1+7/10d   KP+7/10d+ST''   KP+II+7d+ST  operator assist  10xxx+0         KP+ST'''        KP+II+7d+ST  special toll     10xxx+0+7/10d   KP+7/10d+ST'''  KP+II+7d+ST============================================================coin:============================================================  direct dialed    10xxx+1+7/10d   KP+7/10d+ST     KP+II+7d+ST  operator assist  10xxx+0         KP+ST'          KP+II+7d+ST  special toll     10xxx+0+7/10d   KP+7/10d+ST'    KP+II+7d+ST=============================================================================Intra-LATA calls=============================================================================noncoin:=============================================================================  direct dialed       10xxx+1+7/10d        KP+7/10d+ST''         KP+II+7d+ST'  operator assist     10xxx+0              KP+ST'''              KP+II+7d+ST'  special toll        10xxx+0+7/10d        KP+7/10d+ST'''        KP+II+7d+ST'=============================================================================coin:=============================================================================  direct dialed       10xxx+1+7/10d        KP+7/10d+ST           KP+II+7d+ST'  operator assist     10xxx+0              KP+ST'                KP+II+7d+ST'  special toll        10xxx+0+7/10d        KP+7/10d+ST'          KP+II+7d+ST'=============================================================================Note: ST=Start, ST'=STart prime, ST''=Start double prime, ST'''=STart tripleprime.  Once again, the above table appears somewhat intimidating in its complexity.All these STs, ST primes, etc.  Actually, the only purpose of the starts is todistinguish to the TSPS machine exactly what type of call the customer isplacing and from what type of telefone he is calling.  "Special toll" calls arecollect, credit card, and third-party billing type calls.  Here is an exampleof a complete dialing and outpulsing sequence for an operator service call:                                    Page 154                        The Official Phreaker's Manualfrom a coin fone, a customer dials 0+ (or 10xxx+) 303+979-9997.  The centraloffice would seize a trunk to the operator service facility and outpulse:KP+303+979-9997+ST'.  This indicates to the operator service facility that thecall is a special toll call originating from a coin telephone.  The OS facilitycomes off-hook and the central office would then outpulse KP+00+232+9969+ST.This is he ANI information, and the ST indicates that the call is inter-LATA(if it were intra-LATA, the sequence would be terminated with ST' instead).  Perhaps now I should explain screening.  Certain telefones are "screened"against placing certain types of calls.  A screening code is a two digitinformation carrier.  For instance, 00 is "identified line" (no specialtreatment), 01 is multiparty ONI (operator number identification), 02 is ANIfailure, 06 is hotel/motel, 07 is coinless (hospital/inmate fone), 08 isinter-LATA restricted, 68 is hotel inter-LATA restricted, 78 is coinless(hospital inmate) inter-LATA restricted, etc.  A 98 is an AT&T Charge-A-Callfone (those blue fuckers).  More screening codes are allocated as they areneeded. Note that the original TSPS screening design only allowed for singledigit information digits.  They were later found to be insufficient.  I believe that the operator services have been adequately covered, so I willnow move on to other aspects of Equal Access.                                 =============                                 Routing Codes                                 =============  The TTC (terminating toll centre) and special routing codes will continue tobe used in inter-LATA networks.  These 0xx and 1xx type codes, which sometimesprecede operator routing codes, will be assigned to various ICs on anindividual basis.  When 0xx and 1xx codes serve as pseudo-central office code,they will be coordinated such that it will avoid IC conflicts.  TheNumbering/Dialing Planning Group of the Central Services Organization (soundslike some sort of Communist governing body) will provide assistance where theassignment of coordinated codes is necessary.                              ==================                              Special Area Codes                              ==================  Special area codes, also called Service Area Codes (SACs) presented thedesigners of Equal Access with an interesting problem.  SACs are N00 type areacodes, such as 700, 800, and 900.  They are used for special services andunlike normal area codes, are not associated with a particular state or region.Each long distance carrier will be allocated its own exchanges in each servicearea code.  Thus, when a customer places a call to a number in a service areacode, the central office will examine the exchange of the telefone number androute the call over the proper carrier's facilities.  The customer will betotally oblivious to this process. Current SACs include 700 (teleconferencing),800 (toll free services), and 900 (dial-it services).  There are currentlyplans under way to implement the 600 area code, although its exact uses are notyet clear.                               ================                               Signalling to IC                               ================  Each long distance carrier that wishes to serve a particular LATA mustestablish a point of presence (POP) in that LATA.  A carrier's POP is a tolloffice that receives toll traffic destined for another LATA.  A POP is a centrefor inter-LATA transport of toll traffic. This traffic will be directed to it                                    Page 155                        The Official Phreaker's Manualfrom a Bell central office, either an end office or an access tandem (AT).  Anaccess tandem is simply a Bell office which directs long distance traffic froma number of local end offices to a number of different inter-LATA carriers.  Topass call details (such as called and calling numbers) from the Bell localoffice to the inter-LATA carrier, a signalling system was designed that employscurrent multifrequency (MF) signalling protocol.  When a customer dials10xxx+(1/0)+(NPA)+NXX+, the end office will seize a trunk to the appropriate ICas determined by the 10xxx CAC (or primary carrier if no CAC is dialed).  Note:this happens as soon as the customer finishes dialing the exchange, even thoughhe may still be dialing the last four digits of he telefone number.  After thethe signal to proceed.  Then, the end office will send ANI information, in theformat of: KP+II+10 digit ANI+ST.  If the carrier is not to receive ANIinformation from the Bell Operating Company (i.e., they are not paying for it),then only KP+ST is sent. Presumably, by now the customer has completed dialingthe last four digits of the destination telefone number, so the end office willsend: KP+7 or 10 digit CALLED number+ST.  Note several things here: 1) The ICdoes not send a wink when it is ready to receive CALLED number information.  2)ANI information is ten digits, plus a two-digit screening code, and 3) Thecentral office's outpulsing to the IC overlaps the customer's dialing.  Some ANI screening codes include: 00 (identified POTS), 01 (ONI multiparty),02 (ANI failure), 06 (hotel without room identification), 07 (coinless,hospital, inmate, etc.), 08 (inter-LATA restriction), 10 (test call), 20 (AIODcalls, listed DN sent), 27 (coin call), and 95 (test call).  These are the sameor similar as the screening codes used in operator service signalling.  In addition to the domestic signalling design outlined above, a newinternational signalling system has been designed for use with Equal Access.It also uses two-stage, overlapping outpulsing.  After a customer has completeddialing (10xxx)+011+CC (CC is country code), the Bell end office will seize atrunk to he appropriate IC (or international carrier, if direct routing isavailable).  The IC/INC will respond with a wink, and the end office willoutpulse: KP+1NX+YXX+CCC+ST.  Each of these three groups of routing informationindicate something different abut the international call being placed. The 1NXis the "international system routing code, one for each type of call routing."I have absolutely no idea what that means, and no one I have talked to at Bell,AT&T, MCI, CCITT, ITT, the CSO and FCC have any idea either.  Next, the YXX isthe carrier routing code.  It is actually XXX, Which is the three digits of the10xxx CAC for the particular carrier being accessed.  Finally, CCC is thecountry code, padded with a zero if necessary.  One may wonder why the CAC is signalled forward when a trunk is seizeddirectly to the carrier itself.  The reason for this is that in some cases adirect trunk to the carrier is not available and the call must be routedthrough an access tandem, which is responsible for routing calls to a varietyof different long distance carriers.                             ====================                             Switch Compatibility                             ====================  Full-feature Equal Access will become available first for Western Electric#1ESS switching systems.

They can be thought of as miniature areacodes.  A telefone call can never cross a LATA boundary except on an inter-LATAcarrier.  However, there are certain exceptions to this. For example, in thestate of Colorado, which consists of two LATAs, the local Bell OperatingCompany (Mountain Bell), which serves as the intra-LATA (i.e., calls to/fromthe same LATA) carrier, may also serve as inter-LATA (to/from different LATAs)carrier within Colorado.  There are also exceptions in the corridor region of the New York/NewJersey/Pennsylvania area.  The forty-eight continental United States consist of 161 LATAs. Some states,such as Deleware, consist of only one LATA, while others, such as Illinois, canhave up to 14 or more.  Each LATA is given a name.  For instance, Pennsylvaniaconsists of six LATAs: Philadelphia, Capital, Northeast, Altoona, Pittsburgh,and Erie (independent telco).                                ==============                                A Few Thoughts                                ==============  In 1973, Chrysler, A&P, RCA, Phillips Petroleum, S.S. Kresge, BoeingAircraft, International Harvester, Woolworth's, Greyhound, Firestone, Litton,and General Foods, among others, each reported annual profits of less than $150million.  In that same year, the Telephone Company wrote off, as beinguncollectable, debts of $150 million.  In 1974, the Bell System had direct interests in at least 276 organizations,many of them not related to the telefone industry. Bell also had interlockingfinancial arrangements with such corporations as the Chase Manhattan Bank, IBM,Prudential Insurance, Sears Roebuck, General Motors, U.S. Steel, and LeverBrothers.  Should the need have arisen, the Bell System in 1974 could haveexercised control of 400 billion dollars, fully one-third of that year's grossnational product.From: Hyde, J.

I tend todisagree with this.  I think that within three decades the entire telefoneindustry will be consolidated and nationalized.  It will be owned and operatedentirely by the United States Federal Government.  This will accomplish severalgoals of the government.  First, the immense revenue from telefone serviceswill provide great financial resources for the federal government.  Rates fortelefone services will skyrocket far out of the range of affordability, qualityof service will deteriorate to a point of unusability, and meanwhilepoliticians will get rich.  Second, once the government controls the telefone system, monitoring thegeneral public will become infinitely easier.  Big Brother will be able to keepand eye, or rather, an ear on the general population, and giant step forward in                                    Page 157                        The Official Phreaker's Manualultimate government control of peoples' lives will be achieved.  Most peoplewon't know anything about this, and even if they do, they won't give a shitbecause by then the fucking government will have already invaded everyremaining private aspect of the individual's life.  To those who find it utterly unthinkable that the federal government wouldever assume control of the telefone industry, I would call attention to thesituation that existed between 1917 and 1919.  During this time the governmentcontrolled the phone system of the United States.  J. Edward Hyde sums it upbeautifully:     Between 1917 and 1919, the Federal Government did control the phoneindustry.  Since then, the most charitable historians have blamed thesubsequent mess on the First World War.  Others blame it on the democrats.  Butthe fact is that it was a fiasco of the bureaucracy's own making, combined withintracompany sabotage.     Today, in those countries where the phone service is nationally owned, theservice runs from poor to nonexistent.  Would you want the government that gaveyou the Russian wheat deals, Defense Department     overruns, Amtrak, and thePostal Service handling your phone problems?From: Hyde, J.

Advertising campaigns emphasize such aspects as low ratesand operator assistance, but no one mentions a factor that will affect modemusers who use auto dialers for long distance calls.  Not all of the alternatelong distance carriers provide called party answering supervision on all calls.Called party answering supervision basically has the telephone company startbilling only when the called party answers the telephone.  However, many of thealternate long distance companies still operate with the "fixed timeout" basisfor charging.  That is, if a call is held for a fixed length of time (usually30 seconds) the charging starts, whether or not the call was answered.  Thiscould cause modem owners large bills if they use autodialers to make longdistance calls.  Modems are usually set up to wait up to one minute whenattempting to make a call, and thus have to timeout through busy signals, longcall setup sequences, extender waits, and similar problems.  This could resultin many billed but never answered calls.    Some of the other carriers provide it on calls to some cities, and othersnot support it at all.  Only AT&T Communications provides called partyanswering supervision on all calls to all points at this time.  It is almostimpossible to get information on how a long distance company charges its callsas as they don't want to reveal how their billing is handled.  The alternatecarriers get called party supervision when the destination location goes equalaccess.  However, there has been no quick action on the part of the alternatelong distance companies to make use of the supervision data as they would haveto get equipment for passing the information back to the billing computer atthe originating point.  Thus called party answering supervision informationoften ends up being ignored by these carriers even when available.  Anotherpoint to remember is that called party answering supervision's availabilitydepends on whether the destination has equal access, not the originatinglocation.  The lower long distance rates of alternate long distance rates mustbe weighed against the time out problem as it affects autodialing modems.  Oneway to circumvent this is merely to set your modem to a shorterwaiting-for-connect time, but this may not provide enough time for the call togo through.

Lightguide fiber isdramatically expanding the capacity of local networks, helping to lower thecosts and increase the demand for high-band width, Information Age services.And public networks are increasingly digital and geared for data and special services.  For example:o   The AT&T Network Systems 5ESS (TM <riiiight>) switch, designed by BellLaboratories, can serve as the hub of a local deployment of remote modules atlocations up to 100 miles from a host central office.o   The Integrated Special Services Network (ISSN) is a channel network thatprovides special services, customer control options and digital private linesrearrangeable under software control. The ISSN incorporates digital carrierterminating equipment such as the D4 Channel Bank, D5 Digital Terminal Systemand Digital Access and Cross-connect System (DACS).o   The New Centrex is bringing greater levels of customer control, improvedservices and a broad range of data capabilities to the business customer.   Today's public networks consist of multiple or overlay networks. The publicswitched network, or circuit network, mainly for voice, is the base network.Two kinds of overlay networks provide special services.  Channel networks carryprivate lines leased by large customers and transmit much of today's data andimage traffic; they also handle traffic for network operations support.  Packetnetworks carry data communications, while packet switching is used internallyto public networks for common channel signaling to set up, route and take downcalls, or to give customers information. "Overlay networks helptelecommunications companies efficiently meet growing demand for digitaltransmission and special services," says Stan Johnston, Market PlanningManager, Network Systems Evolution, in AT&T Network Systems. "Their integrationinto a single network, however, would be still more effective."Phase two, the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).DDDDD DDDD DDD DDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDD DDDDDDD DDDDDDD DDDDDDD  The ISDN is a concept to which AT&T is committed - and it's the foundationfor Universal Information Services.  The central idea of ISDN, as AT&T NetworkSystems sees it, is to provide an individual user a link to the local centralinto two 64,000-bit channels, which may carry voice or data or both, and one16,000-bit channel for packetized signaling information or data transport.Such a link provides convenient "integrated" network access by accommodatingvoice, data and signaling over a single line.  The ISDN will make it easier for a customer to get varied services frompublic and private networks.  More bandwidth for big customers will beavailable through another ISDN access standard, the extended digital subscriber                                    Page 161                        The Official Phreaker's Manualline, which provides 1.5 billion bits per second as 24 channels of 64,000 bitseach.   In 1986, new software from Bell Labs will enable the 5ESS switch toaccommodate ISDN-sized 144,000-bit channels that standardize and simplifysubscribers' use of local networks.  AT&T is committed to future products thatwill also be ISDN-compatible.  Other vendors, too, some of whom already plan tobuild premises, terminal, and other equipment to ISDN standards, will make ISDNa cooperative effort.   By providing integrated digital access to networks, ISDN will make importantprogress toward the goal of Universal Information Services. But overlaynetworks will continue to divvy up the transport job.  And messages needingless than 144,000 bits per second will not fill their allotted bandwidth,leaving capacity under utilized.Phase three, Universal Information Services.DDDDD DDDDDD DDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD   Rooted in the fertile ground of 5ESS switches, ISDN equipment andtechnologies such as wideband packet transport, Universal Information Serviceswill bear fruit during the 1990s.  From a single kind of network will hangservices as different as apples, oranges and pears. Just as network access wasintegrated in ISDN, transport functions will increasingly be integrated bypowerful new network equipment evolved from equipment developed for the ISDN.Where customers once got standard-sized ISDN channels, they'll get bigbandwidth for large jobs, little bandwidth for small jobs.                                    Page 162                        The Official Phreaker's Manual                TOWARD UNIVERSAL INFORMATION SERVICES VIA ISDNPhase one, the present.

MCI has applied for licenses toprovide cellular service in 81 metropolitan areas.MCI Airsignal Branch Sales Offices                                    Page 166                        The Official Phreaker's ManualPersonal Message Service/Conventional Mobile Phone ServiceBirmingham                             (205)  942-2924Sacramento                             (916)  444-2350Memphis                                (901)  682-9658Cleveland                              (216)  464-7311Dallas                                 (214)  788-5111Fresno                                 (209)  486-7410Las Vegas                              (702)  382-7461Denver                                 (303)  778-7878Portland                               (503)  227-2556Philadelphia                           (215)  677-9845Atlanta                                (404)  252-2114West Florida                           (813)  875-3404Minneapolis                            (612)  544-8175Kansas City                            (913)  648-8090Miami                                  (305)  491-0122Pittsburgh                             (412)  343-1611Houston                                (713)  464-2516Bakersfield                            (805)  832-2346Cellular Telephone Offices            Minneapolis-St. Paul                   (612)  544-3312            Los Angeles                            (714)  527-0385            Elsewhere in California                (800)  344-3455            Headquarters - Washington, D.C.

Customers can sendmessages at any time, even though the receiving terminal may be unattended. MCIInternational offers access to its telex service from a variety of terminalsand networks; not only subscribers with telex terminals but also those withcommunicating word processors, data terminals or computers that communicateover telephone lines can take advantage of MCI International telex service.  Tosubscribers connected to its own telex network, MCI International offers WorldMessage Services--a package of communications offerings including telex,cablegram and MCI Mail services.  Various service enhancements are available tosave time, improve operating efficiency and simplify records keeping for telexusers.CABLEGRAM SERVICE, the traditional means of international writtencommunications, offers flexibility in delivery and economical rates for shortermessages.  Cablegrams can be delivered to virtually any overseaspoint.Subscribers with telex terminals or various other types of equipment canaccess and TELUS cablegram switch and take advantage of such service                                    Page 167                        The Official Phreaker's Manualenhancements as abbreviated addressing and departmental billing.LEASEDCHANNEL SERVICE  provides an exclusive line between a U.S. firm and it'soverseas office for private communications 24 hours a day.  Each MCIInternational leased channel is tailored to meet the needs of a specificcustomer for teleprinter, facsimile, voice and/or data traffic. For subscriberswith several offices requiring private communications with each other, MCIInternational offers a versatile message-switching service. Voice/data leasescan be configured to meet a whole array of communicating needs; for example,one channel might carry data traffic from a computer at night, voicecommunications during office hours, and simultaneous teleprinter messages atany time.  Data channels can handle requirements for traffic at any speed from1200 bits per second to 1.544 megabits per second.IMPACS SERVICE   uses packet-switching technology to provide internationalcommunications service between data terminals and computers.  Impacs offerson-line, real-time connections and enables many types of incompatible systemsto communicate.  Impacs service offers virtually error-free transmissionbecause of the error-detection and retransmission capability of the network.INSTALINK SERVICE allows businesses overseas to use regular telex equipment toaccess remote computing systems and databases in the U.S.  Subscribers canretrieve data from a computer-based information service or use a computingsystem connecting to a packet-switching network in the U.S.INTERNATIONALFACSIMILE SERVICE enables subscribers to send duplicates of original documentsoverseas quickly and efficiently, even when neither the sender or the receiverhas facsimile transmission equipment, or when the sender and receiver haveincompatible equipment.DATEL SERVICE  provides automatic or voice-coordinated data transmission atspeeds up to 2400 bits per second. Either digital or analog facsimile trafficcan be transmitted via Datel.  Datel facilities are conditioned to ensurehigh-quality transmission.  The MCI International switching center allowscommunications between incompatible terminals.MARITIME SERVICES   provide instant, high--quality contact between ships at seaor offshore rigs, and between these vessels and land-based subscribersworldwide.International Voice ServicesPRIVATELINE SERVICE   provides, fast, easy access to a single overseas location at aneconomical monthly rate.  This technically efficient system maximizes the useof line capacity by recognizing idle time and assigning a speaker to atransmission path only when the path is needed.  Users can dial a four-digitextension from a regular business phone to reach a key overseas location.International Mail ServicesWORLDMESSAGE SERVICE   subscribers can access the domestic electronic mail andhard-copy delivery offerings of MCI Mail.  In addition, MCI International isdeveloping fast, low-cost services that will deliver electronic messages andhigh-quality printed documents worldwide.                                    Page 168                        The Official Phreaker's ManualCustomer ServiceTHE CUSTOMER TROUBLE REPORTING ASSISTANCE CENTER at MCI International addressescustomer concerns such as equipment maintenance and service performancequestions.

It is plugged into the phone line, and when thephone rings, it  will immediately intercept the ring and broadcast into thephone any sound that is in the room. This device was originally made byInformation Unlimited, and had a touch tone decoder to prevent all who did notknow the code from being able to use the phone in its normal way.  Thisversion, however, will activate the microphone for anyone who calls while it isin operation.NOTE:  It is illegal to use this device to try to bug someone. It is alsopretty stupid because they are fairly noticeable.Parts List:Pretend that uF means micro Farad, cap= capacitorPart           #          Description----           -          -----------R1,4,8         3         390 k 1/4 watt resistorR2             1         5.6 M 1/4 watt resistorR3,5,6         3         6.8 k 1/4 watt resistorR9,16          2         100 k 1/4 watt resistorR10            1         2.2 k 1/4 watt resistorR13,18         2         1 k 1/4 watt resistorR14            1         470 ohm 1/4 watt resistorR15            1         10 k 1/4 watt resistorR17            1         1 M 1/4 watt resistorC1             1         .05 uF/25 V disc capC2,3,5,6,7     5         1 uF 50 V electrolytic cap or tant                          (preferably non-polarized)C4,11,12       3         .01 uF/50 V disc capC8,10          2         100 uF @ 25 V electrolytic capC9             1         5 uF @ 150 V electrolytic capC13            1         10 uF @ 25 V electrolytic capTM1            1         555 timer dipA1             1         CA3018 amp array in canQ1,2           2         PN2222 npn sil transistorQ3             1         D4OD5 npn pwr tab transistorD1,2           2         50 V 1 amp react. 1N4002T1             1         1.5 k/500 matching transformerM1             1         lar
