The Computer Underground consists of mainly two forms of media, printed
and electronic, both will be discussed in this file.  I use the word
underground because some of the contents of this file are not the types of
titles you would run across at your local bookstore or newsstand.  The kind of
information that makes up underground publications is mainly technical in
nature, but, definitely not limited to that.  One can also find tidbits about
off-the-wall political views, drugs, weapons, and other topics that are not
normally in the mainstream of our society.

The Computer Underground...

Com-put-er Un-der-ground   \kem-`pyt-er\  \`en-der-`grand\ (1970's)

  A group organized in secrecy, hidden behind aliases, to promote the free
  exchange of information regarding anything and everything including but
  not limited to Computers, Telephones, Radios, Chemicals, and ideas.


The CU is made up of men and women all over the globe and of all ages.  Most
of those involved in the CU consider it a hobby, but, there are those that
are involved strictly for illegal purposes, i.e. Selling Pirated Software.  I,
like most people involved enjoy the information that can be obtained through
all of the different avenues in the CU, i.e. Bulletin Boards, Underground
Periodicals, Network Digests, and General Discussions between members.

The most common way members communicate is through Bulletin Boards.  If you are
reading this you know what a BBS is because this will not be released in
printed form.  There are thousands of BBSes around the world run by people for
many reasons including: legitimate businesses, Software Technical Support,
Hobby related, Pirated Software, Message Centers, etc...Some of the more common
ones are RIPCO, Face-2-Face, Exec-PC, The Well, etc...

Currently there are many regular electronic magazines that are being published
and there have been many that have discontinued for one reason or another.
Some current ones include: PHRACK, NIA, PHANTASY, CUD, etc...Some discontinued
ones include: PIRATE, PHUN, NARC, etc...

There is a current debate about whether or not an electronic media has the same
constitutional rights as the printed one.  That is for our congressmen to
decide, but you could voice your opinion.  I personally can't see the differ-
-ence.  Now, don't get me wrong I do not support the publishing of Long-
distance codes or anything of that nature, but, I do support the exchange of
other information, i.e. how to unprotect a game, how to make a smoke bomb,
etc...

There are also "Underground Publications" like TAP, 2600, Cybertek, etc.
These magazines are published in hard copy and deal with every considerable
topic regarding the CU.  Most of these magazines publish completely legal
information that is obtained from public sources and is available to anyone
and everyone.

I doubt that any of the following sources of information would mind if you use
an alias to order any of their material, so I would recommend that you do
just in case!  You might even want to get yourself a private mail box for all
of this "underground" information.  I would also advise you to use a money
order when purchasing anything also.  They usually cost an extra 50 cents at
the post office. Don't worry about using money orders with these people because
I have personally made purchases from many of them without trouble.

The following information is provided to enable you to become more familiar
with the CU and unusual information in general.  Have fun and try not to
get yourself in trouble.

Now for the meat of this Article!!!!

to know that their catalogs cost anything.
