Just as I was aboutready to jump to my death in the ocean because I couldn't call my friends, Igot an idea. Third-party bill my calls to random names in the phone book!Of course, I started out using this method on pay phones which is a pain inthe ass because the operator wants to call up the number you're billing toand make sure it's okay with them first. So here's your detailed instructionsfor simplified third-party billing. Oh, and by the way, in no way am I claimingto be the elite guy who "discovered" third party. I mean, come on, third partybilling's been around forever and some guy said I shouldn't take credit forsomething that's been done forever. I'm just trying to explain how easy it is.Sheesh, some people! Cactus.Finding A Number To Use:-----------------------First of all, if you're going to be calling from home, it's best to chargethe calls to a different area code than your own. Sure, a local number willwork but when the people get their phone bill and see a local number on it,they'll most likely call it to find out what it is. When they see a longdistance number they think "Goodness gracious! If I call that number myphone bill will even be higher." Even if they do call you, you can just playignorant and if they're far away they probably won't come looking for you.Pick a city, any city. The city should be far away in another state. Now diallocal information and ask for the area code to your city. Let's say youpicked Waverly, Iowa. The area code is 319. Now dial 1-319-555-1212 to callWaverly Directory Assisstance. The charge for this call should only be aboutsixty cents.Now think of a very common last name like Smith, Lawrence, Conner, Mitchell,Shlappenheimerwinthrop, etc. You get the idea. OPER: Directory Assisstance, Betty. What city, please? YOU: Waverly.OPER: Go ahead. YOU: I need the number of a last name Conner.OPER: (type, type, type) Okay I have two Conners listed. A Bob and an      initial H. YOU: Bob, yeah that's it. Definately Bob. Bob it is. Gimmie Bob. Yeah, Bob.OPER: The number is 452-0357.So that's the number you'll bill to. 319-452-0357. Of course if you're planning to do this extensively you'll need many more numbers to pick from.That's when you call up the phone company and ask for a phone book to bedelivered to you so you'll have a whole list of numbers to choose from. Anormal book will cost about $7.00 or so. If you know how to do it right, itwon't cost you anything but I won't get into that. The phone book will payfor itself after about 3 or 4 long distance calls.Exchange List:-------------If you don't want to go through all the trouble of doing the above, here's alist of exchanges you can pick from. I'm including the area code and prefix.You just make up four numbers after that at random.               618-254-xxxx 409-744-xxxx 213-962-xxxx 505-398-xxxx                           318-981-xxxx 314-231-xxxx 513-741-xxxx 503-255-xxxx              803-254-xxxx 319-452-xxxx 618-377-xxxx 512-441-xxxxMaking The Call:---------------Pretty easy. Dial 0-AREA CODE-NUMBER. You'll hear a cool Bell tone and theautomated voice will ask you to enter your card number. Press "0" to skipthat part. Recently, they came out with automated third number billing so youdon't have to deal with a live operator anymore. Isn't technology great?! Theautomated voice will ask you to "say" how you want to bill your call. Just say, "third number" and it'll ask you to touch tone in the number you want tocharge it to. Dial 319-452-0357 and presto, your call is completed.If you get a live operator instead say, "I'd like to charge this to my hometelephone in Waverly, Iowa, the Turnip capitol of the world." and follow thesame proceedure.Some of the more intelligent people (about 2%) put a third-number block ontheir line. If this happens the recording will say, "This call cannot be billed to this number." Solution? Hang up, redial the number and try billingit to a different number or just transpose a couple of the numbers you justtried.If you don't have AT&T as your long distance carrier, dial 10288-0-NUMBER.Calling From A Pay Phone:------------------------As I mentioned before, doing it from a pay phone is a little harder but stillworks. The operator will want to call the person you're billing to a verifywith them that it's okay to bill it there. The trick is to open the phone book at the pay phone and pick a number atrandom. Look for an old person's name because they're the most gullible butanyone will do. Let's say you picked Christian Slater 213-962-7142. Dial yournumber as 0-AREA CODE-NUMBER and hit "0" after the tone.OPER: AT&T, How may I help you? YOU: I want to charge this to my home phone.OPER: Will someone be there to accept the charges? YOU: Who wants to know?OPER: Me. YOU: Okay, then, tough guy.OPER: What is your name? YOU: Christian Slater, you may have heard of me.OPER: (dials 213-962-7142. A lady answers the phone. Probably Slater's wife.)LADY: Hello?OPER: Hello, this is AT&T. Christian is making a call from a public phone and      wishes to bill the call to you. Will you accept the charges?LADY: Oh, yeah, okay. I'll accept.And the operator thanks you and puts your call through. As long as you don'tget any of the following responses you should be okay:"Huh? But I'M Christian Slater.""Calling from a pay phone?? But he's right here with me watching Cheers!?""Christian died last week.""No Hablo Engles??"A Few Extra Notes:-----------------Sometimes if the no one is home at the number you're trying to bill to, you can convince the operator that it's really you're number if you know what theanswering machine message is going to say and if you can do an impression oftheir voice on the machine. Even a bad impression will sometimes work.When doing this from home, try not to use the same number more than two orthree times so the owner of the number will be less likely to investigate.I've experienced third-party billing from both sides. Someone charged fortydollars worth of calls to my dad's phone and the operators were very unhelpful and unfriendly. They refused to investigate even though it wascomming from a residential line and it took two months to get the chargesremoved. This was back in 1990 but I've been doing this for a few years nowand people don't seem to care too much at a few calls totaling to under ten bucks. I've actually called the people I used and asked them about it and they almost always blow it off as a "minor nusience."AT&T is completely automated from your home and the best to use. U.S.Sprintis the second best because they're not automated but they also don't call andverify. M.C.I. sucks because they're losers who verify no matter what so don't use them. To choose your company, before you dial the number dial 10288 for AT&T or 10333 for U.S. Sprint.International calls will be verified no matter what from pay phone or home.Hope this file benefits everyone who reads it. It'll sure cut your longdistance bill down a lot.May 13, 1995 Update:-------------------Well, it seems that AT&T are finally waking up to this problem of third partybilling...On my local phone bill I was backbilled for $175 worth of third party calls. The kicker part is that I called the phone company and complainedthat there were all these extra charges on my bill that I know nothing aboutand they were more than happy to take the charges off. A few weeks later, Igot a letter from AT&T concerning some more charges...        Dear Customer,        We are sending you this letter to advise you of the long distance        calls we have billed your account. The amount is $53.70, excluding        taxes. These long distance calls have been investigated by our        Message Analysis Center and were determined to be your responsibility.        A list of these calls will appear on a future bill.        If you would like to discuss this matter, please contact our office        toll-free at 1-800-522-2157, ext. 4737. Our ofice hours are Moday        through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Eastern        Standard Time.        Sincerely,        Dawn Brooks        InvestigatorI've yet to hear anything more about this but I plan to just ignore the extracharges on the bill and complain to the phone company and hopefully I won'thave to pay. If I do, oh well, it's only fifty bucks.Another recent happening is that two people I know have been back billed.Martini from Illinois was charged $75 on her bill. "I don't understand whatthis third number means, sir, I only have two lines!" Also, an idiot in Oregonwas back billed because he had the itelligence to bill to the exact same number every single time. Worse yet, the number was in Canada and it was a non-working number and the last four digits were 1234. What a cool guy!Operator Diverting:------------------A new safe way to get around being back billed is to operator divert beforeyou get AT&T. It's a pain in the ass and takes a little longer, but it worksif you really need to call from home and don't have any other way.Dial "0" and ask that operator to dial 1-800-225-5288 for you. (AT&T) Tell theAT&T operator that you want to place a 3rd party billed call. She'll ask whatnumber you're calling from and you give her the number of somebody that youdon't like so it'll come back on them and not you. Whatever you do, don't giveher your real phone number.ีอออออออออออออContactอTheอPhoneอLosersอOfอAmericaอNearestอYou!อออออออออออออออธณ  Voice:                            ณ Data:                                 ณณ  512-370-4680 PLA Voicemail System ณ 618-797-2339 PLA BBS Illinois Line    ณณ  314-995-1261 Zak's VMB System     ณ 512-883-7543 PLA BBS Texas Line       ณฦออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออต 512-851-8317 Sonic Youth Systems      ณณ U.S. Mailing Address:              ฦอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออตณ Phone Losers Of America            ณ FTP Site: FTP.FC.NET                  ณณ P.O.
