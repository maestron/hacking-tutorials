The generic term for this type of messaging systemis a "voice mailbox". It's nothing more than an answering machine with a fewextra frills. The good thing about voice mailbox hacking, is that there are1-800 access numbers, which makes it easy for anyone who doesn't feel likephreaking to your number, to leave you a message.OPERATING GTE TELEMAIL======================    To play with any voice mailbox, it is usually necessary to have a touchtone fone. This incorporates the standard 0-9 digits and the two function keys.The symbol that looks like a tic-tac-toe sign, "#", is called the pound key.The other is an asterisk, and is called that, or the "star". You will need tobe farmiliar with those to use this system.    GTE Telemail, as like other voice mailoxes are VOICE. IE: You don't useyour modem for hacking this, it's all manual (pain in the butt, yes, I know).If you like, you can try all this out while you are reading the file, just sothat you get used to the service.    The phone number for this service is: 1-800-348-6551. When you first dialthe number, and it answers, you'll hear this: "<Beep><Beep><Beep><Booo> Hello.You've reached the telemessages service. The person you are calling ispresently unavailable. To leave a message, enter the address of the person youare calling; or to access your regular message box, enter the pound sign".    Most of the hacking that you are going to be doing is on the "regularmessage box". This is where the people get the messages that people have sentto them. You would dial the pound key after that announcement. To make yourlife easier, you never have to wait for those recordings to finish. You caninterrupt the lady only after she has begun speaking, but you can dial thepound key right after the beeps. After pressing the pound key, you will hearanother recording: "Please enter your id number". It is here that you wouldenter someone's id number. You will then hear a short "beep". Another recordingwill come on if it is a valid number: "You have XX new messages, and XX savedmessages". New messages are ones that you haven't heard yet, saved messages arethe ones that you wanted to keep for later reading, or rereading.    There are different types of boxes on this service. Some have "GreetingMessages" and "Bulletins", some have a strange method of picking up messages. Iwill go over those now:    If you have messages waiting, you can receive them by dialing "2".Sometimes, it won't give you that option, so you will have to dial "011" foryour new messages, or "012" for your saved messages. When you are listening toyour messages, you may dial a "2" to pause, and another "2" to continue. A "3"will rewind the messages a couple of seconds back, and a "4" will fast forwardthe message. Usually, if you hit the "4" key twice in a row quickly, it willjump to the end of the message and beep, giving you a second menu.    After you have heard the message, you are given these options:        022: Reply back to the person        021: Redirect the message          7: Save the message          5: Delete the message    Dialing the asterisk at any point is like an abort command. It usually willstop what you are doing and go to the last menu before what you are currentlydoing. If you dial the asterisk at the top menu, "To get your new messages,dial 011...etc", you will get a recording that says, "GoodBye", and then behung up.HACKING GTE TELEMAIL====================    ....is a pain, but it works.    The object when hacking these things is find out as many 6 digit personalid codes as possible. You see, to send someone a message, that involves a 7digit code. Since the 6 digit code is easier to get, and gives you moreinformation, you have to scan through an entire prefix of numbers to get asmany id codes as possible.    All you really need is a touch tone fone, and a notebook. It's handy ifyour fone has some kind of memory, and you can recall any number at a singletouch. Like my fone here, there are 12 extra buttons that you can programnumbers into.    First, you have find out a prefix for Texas. You know, a prefix, the firstthree numbers in a seven digit fone number, not counting the area code. There'slots of ways to do this. You can either whip out your fone book, or dial"1-214-555-1212" or "1-817-555-1212". Most of the time, you can phreak to thosetwo numbers from any service. I know that Sprint lets you.    Tear out a separate piece of paper from the notebook, and draw up a chartthat looks similar to this:           0    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           1    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           2    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           3    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           4    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           5    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           6    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           7    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           8    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9           9    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9    The chart stands for numbers from 00-99. The first row, represents "00-09",the second row would be "10-19" (understand?). To read it, the number on thefarthest left is the first digit in the number, then you just go from "0-9" onthe rest of the row for the second digit. It's easier than writing out "00-99"in order.    Now, take the 3 digit prefix in Texas, and add a "0" after it. In otherwords, if the prefix you picked was "123" (No, that's not a real workingprefix), then you'd have "1230". If you are using the programmable fone that Imentioned before, put this four digit number into a key, or somewhere on thefone that you can retrieve it easily.    Dial up the number (1-800-348-6551), and wait for the"<beep><beep><beep><boo>", as soon as you hear the last <Boo> sound, hit thepound key. As soon as the lady begins to speak, hit the key that has those fournumbers programmed into it, or manually dial those four numbers. After that,dial the two digit number that you get from the chart. This should make 6digits in all. If it's an invalid code, you will get this recording: "We'resorry, we are unable to process the id you entered, please try again." As soonas you hear the lady start to say "We're sorry", hit the asterisk button.You'll hear two quick beeps. Cross out the number on the chart that didn'twork. For example:  You just began the dialing, you picked "123" for a prefix,and added the "0" on to get "1230". You were starting from the first line ofyour chart, which looks like this:        0    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9You would dial the number and everything, press the pound sign, and hit the keythat had the "1230" on it, or if you didn't have that kind of fone, you woulddial the "1230" manually. You would then dial a "00". If that was invalid, andthe recording began saying "We're sorry....", you hit the asterisk, and thencross out the zero (not the farthest one on the left).    If the code didn't work, you would go on to the next number. In theexample, you would be dialing "01". If the "123001" didn't work, you'd crossout the "1" and go onto "02".    GTE Telemail only gives you three tries at getting an id code. On the thirdtry, you will get this kind of recording (which, by the way, you can abort, andhit "*" where it will just hang up on you): "We are still unable to processyour id. For assistance, please call 800-527-1149. Thank You" <click>.    Now, let's say that you didn't get one of these recordings, but you heard ashort beep after you entered in the whole id. That means you got a working idcode! On your chart, don't cross out the number, but circle it. In thenotebook, write out the entire 6 digit id code.    If there are no messages on the box, just hit the asterisk until you hear"good-bye", and go onto the next number on your chart. If there ARE messages,you want to read them without the owner knowing. In some situations, that'simpossible, but just don't kill anybody's messages.    You want to try to keep all NEW messages NEW, so that if the original ownerof the box calls up, he will still have the same messeage. GTE operators throwa pissy fit if the messages aren't going through, and they order all of theseconferences with their customers. Anyhow, if there is only 1 new message, afteryou've listened to it, press the "*" button, and that will keep the messagenew. If there are more than one, press "7" to put the message into the "savedmessages bank" after you have listened to them, except for the last message,which you can still keep as new by hitting the asterisk.    Reading saved messages is easier because nobody has to know that you didit. Usually after reading your new messages, the system will say, "beginningsaved messages" if there are any. Otherwise, just dial "012" from the main menufor the saved messages. Remember to save all of these messages with the "7"button.    Now, the object here, when listening to all of these messages is to findout as much information as possible about the owner of that id code, and thepeople that are sending the message to that box. Let's say you are listening toa message, and you hear this:  "John, this is Michael". That's great, you wouldscratch down "John - Michael" in your notebook right after where you wrote downthat box's id number. This will remind you that John owns that box, and Michaelsent the message to him.    If you EVER hear them giving out the 7 digit address codes over atelemessagenger, be sure to write that down too. Any other information ishandy, too.    Now, what on earth are you going to do with all of this information? You'regoing to set up your own boxes! Or at least take over other people's boxes. Thefirst method is called "Read and Reply". Let's say, for example, you had onebox, and a message was sent that said, "Hello John, this is Michael.", and onanother box, you heard a message that said, "Hello Michael, this is Judy", youmight have a match. You see, since you now know Michael's box number, andMichael sent a message to this John dude, all you have to do is go to the firstbox and reply to the message that Michael sent, and it will be sent back toMichael's box.    So, this is exactly what you must do if you think you have a match (I willuse the example above for references to make this easier):   Ex.:          Id Code: 123000 had a message to John, from Michael          Id Code: 123050 had a message to Micahael, from Bubba.   Ok, so you think that you have a match. You would go to the box that had themessage >FROM< the guy who's box you know. In other words, you would dial"12300", and listen to the John/Michael message again. Press the "4" button tofast forward through the message, until you hear the beep. Dial a "022" toreply to the message. You would then dial a "1" to begin your messagerecording, where you would say the last 3 digits into the phone (in this case,you would say "000"), and press "5" to end the recording. It will then say "Youreply has been sent. You may now dial 022 to reply...etc". Just press theasterisk until it says "good-bye", and call back.    When you get on, get ontothe id number 123050, because that's the id that you think is the same thatsent that John dude a message. If there is a new message, with your voicesaying "000" into it, you got it! More on this in a second.   Don't cry if the boxes don't match up and the message doesn't go through.There is still a chance that there are other people with the same name. Justset them up the same way. Now, if, when you first listened to the messages on abox, heard your voice saying three digits, but you never tried matching them up, then you just got a box! Write down the two numbers together somewhere.   If you have two matches, this is what you do... I am going to use theexamples above with the 123000 and 123050 boxes.  Ok, now you have two boxesthat are "linked" through messages. Your next mission is to get both boxes tohave messages from one another that have YOUR voice on it, and to kill allother messages. In this example, this is what you would do: Get onto the 123000box and reply to the "from michael" message. For your message, don't sayanything, just have about 7 seconds of silence, and then finally hit "5" tofinish the message. Next, you would go to the 123050 box, and would listen tothe 7 seconds of silence message that you just sent. Reply back to this, and dothe same thing. So now, both boxes have these "7 seconds of silence" or "blank"messages in their boxes. Next, you would go to both boxes and kill all of theother messages in the box. Everything, even the "michael" message goes.   You have now siezed the box, and it is at your will. You must pick one boxto be your "update" box, and the other to be your "pickup" box. The "Update"box is the one that will have your greeting message on it, like "You've dialedMaster Micro's box, to send him a message, dial 022 after the tone." The"Pickup" line is the box that will be used for only YOU, where you readmessages that other phreaks have left you. To set these up, do the following:   Go to the box you picked as your "pickup" line. Read the blank message and reply to it. For the message, say whatever, like "This is so-and-so's box, dial022 after the beep to reply". You then dial up the update line, read thewelcome message that you just sent, and hit "7" after listening to it to saveit. You'll hear the blank message somewhere, either as your new or your savedmessage. Kill the blank message on the update line. Now, if you ever wanted tochange your greeting message, go to the pickup line, record a new message byreplying to the blank one; go to the update line, and kill the old greetingthat you don't want, and save the new one.   Once you have your box set up, all you have to do is give all your phreakphriends the address and instructions to the update line. Tell them to save themessages when they read it, and to reply to it using 022 if they want to sendyou a message. Occassionally, check your pickup line for new messages, and killthem after you have read them just in case the owner of the box catches on andchanges his id code.   The other method to set up boxes is used mainly for setting up codelines, orother kinds of boxes where you don't want replies, or it is not totallynecessary to have replies. A codeline is a voice box that you have devoted totelling your phriends new codes, and any other new info. Setting these up areeasy as hell, and you can make as many as you want, but there is a catch. Youmust have figured out both the 7 digit address code, and the 6 digit id codefor the same box. Let's say there was a dude named Frank, and his address code(the number you dial as soon as you get on, instead of dialing the pound keyand id number, to send the guy a message) was "1234567", and his id code was"098765".  First, to find out if the address and the id code are the same, youdo the same method of matching up first names. Call up the telemail service,and instead of dialing the pound key and everything, dial the 7 digit addresscode, and send a message saying something like, "yess umm.. <click>" and hit 5.They'll think it's a screwed up message that didn't go through if the addressand the id code aren't for the same box. Anyways, after you send the message,you'll be hung up on by GTE. Just call back, and this time enter the pound andthe 6 digit id code (in this case, 098765). If there is a message that says,"yess umm.. ", then you go it! Then next thing you do is jump up and down andpop yourself open a brewski.   After you've popped open your brewski, make sure you are still coherentenough to set up a codeline, or whatever else you want to set up. I was gonnaset up those 1-212-970-XXXX phone sex recordings on a few, because you can setup as many as you want; just to amuse the kiddies, and show them your power.Anyhow, whip out your notebook, and pick a box that has no messages in it. Ifyou don't have any, then pick a box, and go to it, and kill off all of themessages. Go to that box, and after the recording tells you that you have nonew and no saved messages, you will be given a menu. Dial the address code ofthe box that you have the id and address to (in this case, 1234567). Enter amessage, that says anything you want -- if you can't think of anything, just dothe 'ole blank message. Save it and everything. You then dial the asteriskuntil you get hung up, and then call back again. This time, enter the id codeof the box that you have both the addr and id to. When you hear the messagethat you just sent from the other box, reply to it, and in that message, putwhatever you want into it. After you are done, just kill the message you justheard, so there is nothing on the box that you have both info for. Now, you canscrew around with the other box that you set up, but try not to have anymessages, or anything screwy on the both you have both things for. If you do,you're just going to wind up having it dead, so that's my warning. Tell people,when you give out the other box number, the one you just set up, not to replyto send you messages.    Ok, now, going back to near the beginning of the file, about talk of thechart, let's say you went from 00 to 99, and you've filled out your chart. Theprefix you were using was: 1230. You would then change that "0" to a "1". Soyour new four number prefix would be 1231. Keep doing this until you are bored,or you have gone up to 1239. Then, you have to pick a new Texan prefix, andstart with 0 again. Now, that's a lot of numbers...    Also, that 1-800 number is not the only one in the country. There areseveral others. There is probably a GTE in lots of the major states. If youfind any new numbers, look for prefixes for THAT state and not Texas. Shit, Idon't even live in Texas. I live in Russia."This is Master Micro for the Underground America Codeline............." Thank You for your support.Special Thanks to Mr. Xerox - who if I didn't blow school for that day, and hedidn't blow work, would have never found out the formats for GTE Telemail.Also, because of his board, him and I started hacking and phreaking again, andwithout Underground America, I wouldn't be typing this file right now.DOWNLOADED FROM P-80 SYSTEMS......
