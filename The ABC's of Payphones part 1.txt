                                MAD! PRESENTS...                         THE ABC'S OF PAYPHONES PART 1The information presented in this file is for entertainment purposesonly.  The authors of this file take no responsibility for any of itscontents.The following text file is for AT&T & GTE payphones from 1982-1985. somethings are different on gte phones, so additions are included for them.Section 1:The coin slotFor every 5 cents you put in a phone, a sound is made.  After you putthe coins in the slot, they pass through a  totalizer which counts them.They then collect in a hopper.  To empty out the hopper, all you have todo is activate the coin relay.  Payphones sometimes hold $100 or more.To activate the relay place 5 cents in the phone.  Stick a magnet up thecoin slot about 5 inches.  Now remove the front panel of the phone. Youwill see a series of wires.  Cut the red and green wires.  Now in thefront of the panel you will see three screws. Touch the green wire tothe third screw.  Better have a hat ready, because alot of change isgonna come flooding out.  Isn't this fun?Section 2:free creditsIf you have a friend jn germany you need to call this section's for you.One of the cheap things about pay phones is they depend on tones to tellthem you inserted money.  Well if you have a red box these tones areeasily duplicated, but i want to show you how do it without boxes inthis file.  Now Some things you need are... A set of screwdrivers.  You willneed both philips and flathead.  Now open the front panel of the phone and cutthe red and green wires.  Take the cover off the top of the phone and insert 5cents.  You should hear nothing.  Find a green wire coming from the coin slotdown to the hopper.  Disconnect that wire.  Now take off the case and you willsee a small switch.  Move the switch.  This sets the totalizer backwards 1.Now put the hopper cover back on and reconnect the wire. Back to the frontpanel.  Feel to the right of the two screws.  You should feel 4 jumpers.1 of the jumpers should be disconnected.  Reconnect it. Now cut the topjumper. You should hear a loud pop.  Now touch the green wire to the secondscrew.  You will hear the sound of twenty five cents being inserted.  You nowhave 30 cents credit.  Repeat as many times as you need. Now reconnect thegreen wire and dial your number.GTE Notes:The green wire will be white. The red one will be blue.  The totalizeris located at the bottem of the front panel.In part 2 we will show you how to take the payphone apart, and how totake one home.
