<p><b><font size="4"><a name="1"></a>Introduction:</font></b></p>
<p>When a computer is turned on an Operating System must be loaded into the computer's 
  memory before the user can begin using it. IBM compatible machines use an operating 
  system called MS-DOS. MS stands for &quot;MicroSoft&quot; (a trade name), while 
  DOS stands for &quot;Disk Operating System&quot;, which tells us that it's original 
  purpose was to provide an interface between a computer and its disk drives. 
  Technically, DOS is a high-level interface between an application program and 
  the computer. </p>
<p>DOS has been extended further, allowing programs to handle the likes of simple 
  memory management, disk operations, assorted system tasks (e.g. date/time), 
  user input commands and managing input/output (i/o) devices (i.e. it provides 
  operating instructions for the computer to manage both hardware and software). 
  Versions 3.1 and up also provide basic networking functions.</p>
<p>Beyond this, DOS provides the user with the important facility of file and 
  disk management (often referred to as disk-housekeeping). This part of DOS is 
  particularly crucial to the user as it was specifically designed for him or 
  her to interact with.</p>
<p>With the advent of installable device drivers and TSR (Terminate but Stay Resident) 
  programs in DOS v2.0, the basic DOS functions could be extended to handle virtually 
  any scale of operations required. This was the first instance of multiple programs 
  being run at once in DOS. Some TSR's can however interfere with the running 
  of programs. When a program is loaded into memory it assumes that it has exclusive 
  use of this memory and will not take into account the fact that another program 
  (the TSR) is also using this area. Thus a conflict can arise causing the program 
  to hang (hang means that the screen freezes and the task being executed stops 
  responding forcing the user to either switch off or reboot the computer).</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="2"></a>History:</font></b></p>
<p>The development of MS-DOS/PC-DOS began in October 1980, when IBM began searching 
  the market for a suitable operating system to go with their soon to be released 
  IBM PC's (commercial Personal Computers). IBM had originally intended to use 
  Digital Research's industry standard operating system - CP/M (Control Program/Monitor 
  or Control Program for Microcomputer - originally written in 1973 by Gary Kildall 
  in his PL/M language). This was never implemented due to uncertain reasons, 
  the most likely being poor diplomatic relations between the two companies. Later, 
  IBM approached a relatively small company called Microsoft, which specialised 
  in language vending. Bill Gates and Paul Allen had written Microsoft BASIC and 
  were selling it on punched tape or disk to early PC hobbyists.</p>
<p>Earlier, in April 1980, Tim Patterson began writing an operating system for 
  use with Seattle Computer Products' 8086-based (S100 bus micros) computer. Seattle 
  Computer Products decided to come up with their own disk operating system, due 
  to delays by Digital Research in releasing a CP/M-86 operating system. By August 
  86-DOS or QDOS v0.10 (Quick and Dirty Operating System) was shipped by Seattle 
  Computer Products. It was a 16-bit version of CP/M. Even though it had been 
  created in only two man-months, the DOS worked surprisingly well. A week later, 
  the EDLIN line editor was created. EDLIN was supposed to last only six months, 
  before being replaced, but it endured for longer.</p>
<p>In September Tim Patterson showed Microsoft his 86-DOS, written for the 8086 
  chip. At this stage Microsoft had no 8086 real operating system to offer, but 
  capitalized when, in October, Microsoft's Paul Allen contacted Patterson, asking 
  for the rights to sell SCP's DOS to an unnamed client (IBM). Microsoft paid 
  less than $100 000 for the rights. Patterson's DOS v1.0 was approximately 4000 
  lines of assembler source. This code was quickly polished up and presented to 
  IBM for evaluation.</p>
<p>An agreement was reached between the two companies and IBM agreed to accept 
  86-DOS as the main operating system for their new PC. In February 1981, 86-DOS 
  was run for the first time on IBM's prototype microcomputer. Furthermore, Microsoft 
  purchased all rights to 86-DOS in July 1981.</p>
<p>In August, IBM announced the IBM 5150 PC, featuring a 4.77-MHz Intel 8088 CPU, 
  64KB RAM, 40KB ROM, one 5.25-inch floppy drive, and PC-DOS 1.0 (Microsoft's 
  MS-DOS), for $3000.</p>
<p>Thus, &quot;IBM Personal Computer DOS v1.0&quot; was available for the introduction 
  of the IBM PC in October 1981. IBM heavily subjected the program to an extensive 
  quality-assurance test and found there to be well over 300 bugs and decided 
  to rewrite the programs. This is why PC-DOS is copyrighted to both Microsoft 
  and IBM.</p>
<p>Some early OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture) versions of DOS had different 
  names such as Compaq-DOS, Z-DOS, Software Bus 86, etc. By version 2.0 Microsoft 
  had succeeded to persuade everyone but IBM to call it MS-DOS.</p>
<p>It is interesting to reflect on the fact that the IBM PC was not originally 
  meant to run MS-DOS. Instead it was supposed to use a (not yet in existence) 
  8086 version of CP/M. On the other hand, DOS was originally written before the 
  IBM PC was created. CP/M-86 would have been the main operating system except 
  for two things: Digital Research wanted $495 for CP/M-86 (considering PC-DOS 
  was basically free) and many software developers found it easier to port software 
  from CP/M into PC-DOS than into CP/M-86.</p>
<p>The IBM PC was first shipped without an operating system. IBM only started 
  including DOS when the second generation AT/339 came out. A user could order 
  one of three available operating systems: IBM PC-DOS, a version of UCSD p-System 
  (type of integrated Pascal operating system - like the improved BASIC operating 
  systems used by the Commodore 64,) and CP/M-86, which was officially an option 
  even though it was unavailable until later on. Since IBM's $39.95 DOS was much 
  cheaper than anyone else's it soon became the most popular.</p>
<p>An upgrade from DOS v3.3 to v4.0 was solely done by IBM, it was later licenced 
  back to Microsoft. In early 1990 IBM declared that it would be ceasing development 
  of DOS, handing the reigns over to Microsoft from then on.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Press' &quot;MSDOS Encyclopaedia&quot; illustrated an example of 
  a late DOS v1.25 OEM brochure. Microsoft was praising future enhancement to 
  v1.25 including XENIX-compatible pipes, process forks and multitasking, as well 
  as &quot;graphics and cursor positioning, kanji support, multi-user and hard 
  disk support and networking&quot;. Despite these large aspirations, Microsoft 
  failed to produce the forks, multitasking and multi-user support (at least in 
  US versions of DOS).</p>
<p>The notice claimed: &quot;MS-DOS has no practical limit on disk size. MS-DOS 
  uses 4-byte XENIX OS compatible pointers for a file and disk capacity of up 
  to 4 gigabytes.&quot;</p>
<p>For the record they actually delivered:</p>
XENIX-compatible pipes:<br>
DOS 2.0 (&quot;|&quot; operator)<br>
---<br>
process forks, and multitasking:<br>
eDOS 4.0 (not delivered in the US)<br>
---<br>

---<br>

<p>kanji support:<br>

  ---<br>
  hard disk support:<br>
  DOS 2.0 (subdirectories)<br>
  ---<br>
  networking:<br>
  DOS 3.1 (file locking support MS Networks)<br>
  DOS 6.0 (bundled Interlink in with DOS)<br>
  ---</p>
<p>Microsoft launched an aggressive marketing campaign for MS-DOS. Early Microsoft 
  advertisements promoted DOS' XENIX-like features and promised XENIX functionality 
  in future releases.</p>
<p>Microsoft had announced their intention of building a multi-user, multitasking 
  operating system since as early as 1982. They Shipped beta versions of &quot;DOS 
  4.0&quot; in 1986/87 before v3.3 was even announced. Microsoft UK had announced 
  that they had licenced v4.0 to Apricot Computers and the French Postal Service 
  was supposed to be running it.</p>
<p>MS-DOS and PC-DOS have been run on more than just the IBM-PC and clones:</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="3"></a>The Memory Map:</font></b></p>
<p>About a decade ago, standard memory configurations were 256KB, 512KB or 640KB 
  on computers. This memory was often looked at in segments of 65536 bytes or 
  64KB. The user is allocated 10 segments, or 640KB and the system is allocated 
  the remaining 6, or 384KB. The original designers of the 8088, decided that 
  no one would ever possibly need more than 1MB of memory (yeah, right!). So they 
  built the machine so that it couldn't access above 1 MB. To access the whole 
  MEG, 20 bits are needed. This allows a total of 220 combinations of bits, that 
  is 1048576 (= 1024*1024 or 1 MB) different numbers, each of which represents 
  an address of a single byte of data. The problem was that the registers only 
  had 16 bits, and if they used two registers, that would be 32 bits, which was 
  way too much (they thought). So they came up with a rather brilliant (not!) 
  way to do their addressing - they would use two registers. They decided that 
  they would not be 32bits, but the two registers would create 20 bit addressing. 
  And thus Segments and Offsets were created.</p>
<p>**Note: it helps to understand assembly code.</p>
<table width="98%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" align="center">

                     \- Overlap-/</pre>
<p>This shows how DS : SI is used to construct a 20 bit address.</p>
<p>Segment registers are: CS, DS, ES, SS. On the 386+ there are also FS &amp; 
  GS.</p>
<p>Offset registers are: BX, DI, SI, BP, SP, IP. In 386+ protected mode, any general 
  register (not a segment register) can be used as an offset register (except 
  IP, which isn't accessable).</p>
<table width="98%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td>CS</td>
    <td align="center">:</td>

  <tr>
    <td>SS</td>
    <td align="center">:</td>
    <td>SP</td>
    <td>Points to the current stack position.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you'll notice, the value in the segment register is multiplied by 16 (or 
  shifted left 4 bits) and then added to the offest register. Together they create 
  a 20 bit address. Thus, there are many combinations of the segment and offset 
  registers that will produce the same address. The standard notation for a SEGment/OFFset 
  pair is:</p>
<table width="98%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr align="center"> 
    <td>SEGMENT</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>OFFSET or A000</td>
    <td>:</td>
    <td>0000 (in hexadecimal)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Where SEGMENT = 0A000h and OFFSET = 00000h.<br>
  (This happens to be the address of the upper left pixel on a 320x200x256 screen.)<br>
  You may be wondering what would happen if you were to have a segment value of 
  0FFFFh and an offset value of 0FFFFh.</p>
<p>Notice how &lt;0FFFFh * 16 (or 0FFFF0h ) + 0FFFFh = 1,114,095&gt; is larger 
  than 1,048,576 (or 1 MEG).</p>
<p>This means that more than 1 MB of memory is actually accessible! Well, to actually 
  use that extra bit of memory, you would have to enable something called the 
  A20 line, which just enables the 21st bit for addressing. This little extra 
  bit of memory is usually called &quot;HIGH MEMORY&quot; and is used when you 
  load something into high memory or say DOS = HIGH in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file 
  or DEVICEHIGH=MOUSE.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file (HIMEM.SYS and EMS386.EXE actually 
  manage that).</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of a typical memory map:</p>
<p>The IBM PC handles its address space in 64k segments, divided into <br>
  16k fractions and then further as necessary:</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="4"></a>Timeline:</font></b></p>
<p>In May 1982, Microsoft released MS-DOS v1.1 to IBM, for the IBM PC. It supported 
  320KB double-sided floppy disk drives. Microsoft also released MS-DOS v1.25, 
  similar to v1.1 but for IBM-compatible computers.</p>
<p>In March 1983, MS-DOS v2.0 for PCs is announced. It was written from scratch, 
  supporting 10 MB hard drives, a tree-structured file system, and 360 KB floppy 
  disks. October saw IBM introducing PC-DOS v2.1 with the IBM PCjr.</p>
<p>In March 1984, Microsoft released MS-DOS v2.1 for the IBM PCjr. Microsoft released 
  MS-DOS v2.11 a short time later. It included enhancements to better allow conversion 
  into different languages and date formats. In August, Microsoft released MS-DOS 
  v3.0 for PCs. It added support for 1.2MB floppy disks, and bigger (than 10 MB) 
  hard disks. In November, Microsoft released MS-DOS v3.1, adding support for 
  Microsoft networks.</p>
<p>In January 1986, Microsoft released MS-DOS v3.2. It added support for 3.5-inch 
  720 KB floppy disk drives. Microsoft released MS-DOS v3.25 as well.</p>
<p>In April 1987, IBM announced DOS v3.3 for PCs, for $120. In August Microsoft 
  shipped MS-DOS v3.3. In November Compaq shipped MS-DOS v3.31 with support for 
  over 32MB drives.</p>
<p>In 1988 Digital Research transformed CP/M into DR DOS. In June Microsoft released 
  MS-DOS v4.0, including a graphical/mouse interface. In July IBM shipped DOS 
  v4.0, which included a shell menu interface and support for hard disk partitions 
  over 32 MB. In November Microsoft released MS-DOS v4.01.</p>
<p>In April 1990, Microsoft introduced Russian MS-DOS v4.01 for the Soviet market.<br>
  May saw Digital Research releasing DR DOS v5.0.</p>
<p>In June 1991, Microsoft released MS-DOS v5.0. It added a full-screen editor, 
  undelete and unformat utilities and task swapping. GW-BASIC is replaced with 
  Qbasic, based on Microsoft's QuickBASIC. In September Digital Research Inc. 
  releases DR DOS v6.0, for $100.</p>
<p>In March 1993, Microsoft introduced the MS-DOS v6.0 upgrade, including DoubleSpace 
  disk compression. 1 million copies of the new and upgraded versions were sold 
  through retail channels within the first 40 days. In November, Microsoft released 
  MS-DOS v6.2.</p>
<p>In February 1994, Microsoft released MS-DOS v6.21, removing DoubleSpace disk 
  compression. April IBM releases PC-DOS v6.3. In June Microsoft releases MS-DOS 
  v6.22, bringing back disk compression under the name DriveSpace.</p>
<p>In February 1995, IBM announced PC DOS v7, with integrated data compression 
  from Stac Electronics (Stacker). In April, IBM released PC DOS v7. In August 
  of 1995 Microsoft introduced Windows 95, it included MS DOS v7.0 but it's clear 
  that DOS is going to remain a constant for several years to come.</p>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="5"></a>Future of DOS:</font></b></p>
<p>At first, many people would answer saying that DOS has no future. It has seen 
  it's heyday and now it's up to high-resolution GUI's (Graphic User-Interfaces 
  - e.g. Windows 95) to lead the operating system pack. But let's not be too quick 
  to dismiss it. There are many reasons why DOS is an essential part of many of 
  today's finest systems.</p>
<p>Talk to mainstream computer industry &quot;specialists&quot; and they'd have 
  you believe that there is no longer any place for it. Why? Because they don't 
  understand the special speed and performance requirements unique to systems 
  other than &quot;supercomputers with neuro-networking&quot;. I'm talking about 
  the many hundreds of thousands of users that depend on older systems to support 
  their businesses. Low-tech industries rely heavily on computers with old versions 
  of DOS installed on them. The average &quot;business person&quot; here doesn't 
  need anything better than a 486SX with 8MB of RAM to run their MS-DOS based 
  accounting program. This shouldn't be made redundant just because DOS is so-called 
  &quot;outdated&quot;. This is also where the highest resistance to the removal 
  of DOS has come from.</p>
<p>Despite this, many people believe that old DOS programs are becoming redundant 
  because they are not Y2K compliant. But I say that DOS programs are simplistic 
  by nature and can easily be patched to be compatible. Even that seems more sensible 
  than installing Windows and taking up copious quantities of HD space with utilities 
  that have a hundred times more features than you'll ever figure out, let alone 
  use. Don't even get me started on the redundant registry entries and .dll files 
  that remain after 'removing' shareware and evaluation software on Win95. You 
  won't get any of that in DOS!</p>
<p>Win95 and DOS can be compared to bank notes and coin-change respectively. Win95 
  caters for the multiuser/multitasking system which has convenience similar to 
  the spending of large bank notes. DOS caters for the single-task user without 
  the need of extraneous functions and add-ons. Like coins, DOS adds up for too 
  many individuals not to have a large economic impact if it were removed.</p>
<p>One of the great 'new features' of Win95 is it's Recycle Bin (thanks Mac!). 
  But if it's so great, what does a user do if he or she wants to recover a file 
  after having emptied the bin? Nothing? Tough luck? Nope. DOS to the rescue! 
  The user simply needs to 'Restart in MS-DOS mode', type in and confirm the LOCK 
  command, go to the directory where the file was stored (or 'c:\recycled') and 
  undelete it using DOS v6.2x's old UNDELETE.EXE (remember: restart the computer 
  or type in UNLOCK to proceed safely). Conclusion: Windows couldn't have been 
  used to retrieve that 'permenantely' deleted file without using extraneous software 
  (eg. Norton Utilities).</p>
<p>Okay, so I've been heavy-handed about my support for DOS over Windows. Sue 
  me, I like it - it's my 'oldschool'. ;) Although...</p>
<p>Many people support DOS in that they perceive it to be a magical operating 
  system that is just perfect for games. Well I have a challenge for them - TRY 
  PROGRAMMING FOR IT! I'll bet money that half the reason why Interplay's relatively 
  new game &quot;DTUM&quot; didn't ship with network options was simply because 
  it is a DOS game and they would have had to do the bulk of the work themselves. 
  Simply put: if Microsoft wants to write network code for game developers (via 
  Direct Play) or add support to most if not all sound cards (Direct Sound), a 
  designer would be foolish not to take advantage of it. Thus guaranteeing MS 
  role in the games market. Even the mighty Quake(TM) released Windows/OpenGL 
  versions (sell out? - you decide).</p>
<p>Two factors determine the user's productivity: how long it takes to tell the 
  computer to do something, and how long the computer takes to do it. The former 
  is largely dependent on how you've customized your system with shortcuts, macros, 
  and AutoLISP routines and the platform is not particularly relevant. The latter 
  is partly dependent on your choice of platform - any kind of Windows inevitably 
  suffers compared with DOS. Why? Because DOS remains on a lower user level compared 
  to Win95 and thus keeps more of the system's resources free.</p>
<p>Even Windows 98 - the most recent operating system released by Microsoft to 
  date retains elements of DOS for users - obviously Microsoft recognises the 
  great need for it. These elements, however, aren't pure DOS. They're part of 
  Win95/98. A shell (pardon the pun) of its former self if you will. The question 
  is, will Win98 be able to run without these elements? One of the intriguing 
  questions being asked today since the discovery that Win95 works with DR-DOS 
  7.01, is how dependent on DOS is/was Win95? I would have called this myth until 
  I went to fix a Win95 problem and by accident discovered that Win95 appears 
  and runs on top of DOS.</p>
<p>So was it, in fact, essential for Microsoft to retain DOS? Was Win95 already 
  so intricately (/technically) dependent on DOS that the Win98 upgrade wouldn't 
  work without it? Probably not, although speculation is widespread.</p>
<p>I believe that DOS will remain for a few years to come at least. Sentimentality 
  alone can't keep it around forever though and it's only a matter of time before 
  somebody finds a way of phasing it out completely. But not without meeting resistance 
  from individuals for which DOS provides an efficient service. As a DOS junkie, 
  I find it's faster to type many commands or use batch files than having to click 
  and move files around in Windows. What can I say? The mouse slows me down and 
  I think 'user-friendliness' is a sham.</p>
