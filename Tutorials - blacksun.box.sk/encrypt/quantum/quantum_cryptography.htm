<h4><font size="5">Quantum Cryptography</font></h4>

<h4>1) And God said let there be... tutorial</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay can be little out of usual hacking/cracking topic, but I wanted to present you a new technologies that are now used.
Also, this tutorial has a 'growing intension' so it will be updated at time to time.
The needing for update is mainly here because of need for better explanation
because it's hard topic even to those that are familiar with quantum physics and
this tutorial is not written for people that are familiar with quantum physics
and will give you only basic idea about quantum cryptography. I would be very
thankful for any suggestion how to make this tutorial better and clearer because
it's very hard to explain some details of quantum theory to people that are not
familiar with it. I will be most satisfied&nbsp; if this tutorial can read even
my grandmother and get something from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2) Classical heaven =&gt; Quantum hell</h4>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so let's get to basics of quantum theory. First, let
me explain the term '<i>quantum</i>'. As a more careful observer can notice the close
relative to the word quantum is a word quantity. At the very beginning of this
century physicians noticed that there is something wrong with the classical
theory,&nbsp; to be more precise, they've noticed that their perspective of the
fundamental particles they had are not matching the experimental results they
got. The logical conclusion was that there is something wrong with the classical
idea they had about atom. <i> Max Planck</i> therefore has introduced the new approach
to the matter. In the classical physics, electron orbiting (orbiting around is
also relative term, I'll explain it little bit later) around the core or the
atom could have any possible energy, and related to this, could orbit around the
core at any possible distance. The problem with that vision was that because the
electron is negative charged and core, because consisted of positive protons and
neutral neutrons, was positive charged it was expected that electron would collapse
into core for about 0.0000000001 sec (because of different charges, core
attracts electron). The answer was that electron can't have any energy while
orbiting around core, energy of electron is <i> quanted.</i> This means that electron
has strongly defined possible energies, and can orbit only on some distances
around atom. To be more precise, even that is not definitely true, the electron
is not orbiting exactly around orbits, orbits are only defining the place where
is best possibility to find electron. Confused? You should be... at least
shocked if you've never heard about it. This brings us to the rather confusing
and paradoxal world of
quantum mechanics (quantum mechanics - one of parts of physics dealing with the
phenomena of the small world, basically it research the movement of the
particles, parallel to ordinary mechanics in classical world, but much wider).
In world of quantum mechanic we are not talking about the exact value, but the
possible value. To make it more clear, say you want to find the place where is
the particle you're especially interested&nbsp; in, you won't be able to find
the exact spot an say here it is, what you'll get will be something like beaver
that had car accident... one relatively wide circle darkest in the center...
That center is the place where is the greatest probability to find the particle,
but not necessary the place where particle really is. That is consequence of our
impossibility to make perfect measurement. In our world of 'big' objects,
measurements we take are good enough to say 'beaver was 1.5m long' (hmmm... long
beaver), but if you look more careful 1.5m could be 1.485755432m or 1.49532221m
or 1.5000000m, do you get the point, what is behind? You always have error in
measurement. In the world of small object, measurements are so sensitive that
you can't for instance measure the position and impulse (impulse&nbsp; is
product of mass and speed, it determines the movement) of particle, that is for
one of fundamentals of quantum mechanic. Of great importance is to understand
that physics is based on measurement, not on the theory. So let us make
conclusion... Quantum mechanic is dealing with 'small' world of atoms and
fundamental particles, while classical physics founded mainly by Isaac Newton is
dealing with the 'big' world of beavers... In quantum world all observables
(things that we can measure) have discrete values (that means that you can't
have any value of observable, for instance, electron can't have any energy while
orbiting around atom), and we can speak only about probability for real
events... there are many more rules, but these are one of the basic. If you want
to know more, you can take some of many good quantum mechanics books, but
watch... be sure that you're good with linear algebra and you've been through
the higher courses of math, or avoid books with equations.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>3) ...and God also said let there be light
</h4>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've now been through the basics of quantum mechanics,
don't give up... I have to explain to you some facts about light also before I
get to the point. The phenomena of matter is that it's constructed from smaller
parts. The smallest ones that we know that build all other bigger constructions
of nature, like atoms and&nbsp; molecules we call <i>fundamental particles</i>.
What physicians have found was that particles are not particles in a sense of
marbles that are wondering around, but they are also waves. Let me break one
more illusion for you. Particles are not looking like balls, as the matter of
fact you can't say that particle has any shape. If someone shows you a picture
of a black blurred ball, and tells you: &quot;it's the picture of
electron&quot;, he is probably showing you a picture of energy distribution of
electron (... huh it doesn't matter, it's just not the picture of exact particle,
remember that with probability? It's that story). What I'm pointing at? In this
'quantum cryptography' play main role is played by light, so I have to say
something about light and terms like <i>polarization</i> and&nbsp; <i>phase
shift</i>. Let me explain that wave-particle thing. You've probably heard for
photons, and you've probably heard for electro-magnetic waves. See the usual
picture of&nbsp; electromagnetic wave (E - electrical field, B - magnetic field,
x-some direction the light is traveling)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Electro.jpg">
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well that are two views on the same thing we call light.
The light has really bad manners, I could say the light is acting little bit
schizophrenic. It determines of the measure we take, we can see that light is
acting like electro-magnetic wave, or that the light is made of particles we
call photons. No, it's not like water, where we have great amount of particles
that interact and make waves we can see. This is result of fundamental organization
of nature that we call duality. I will stop at this moment with further
explanations why is this that way. Yes there is deeper reason, but... let us
stop here ok?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now explain terms <i>polarization</i> and&nbsp; <i>phase
shift. </i>Do you see that x axis? It the one represented with the long black
line in the middle of graphic. Well, why couldn't you rotate other two axes
around it? There is not any reason why you couldn't rotate the whole picture
around that axis. Let us suppose we have two waves of same wavelength (oh yes,
this is the one more flavors of light, actually that is the value that determines
the energy of wave, and this value determines is this a radio wave, normal
visible light, x - ray, gamma ray etc.), and let them travel the same path x.
But what about that other two axes E and B? One wave must have axes E and B at
the constant angle 90 degrees (you'll also see in further text expressions like
Pi, Pi/2, that is the other way to mark the angles, Pi = 180 degrees, yes that
is the same one Pi = 3.14... Ok, now you know you can rotate those two axes E
and B around axis x and what you can do with it? If you for instance take some arbitrary
position of vectors E and B, let it be position of axes you can see in figure 1
on the picture bellow:
</p>
<p align="center"> <br>
<img border="0" src="Axes.jpg">
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you take positions of vectors E and B like on figure 1
as the arbitrary (polarization is not definitive term, there is not existing
absolute position of&nbsp; vectors E and B but you must first define some
arbitrary position of vectors E and B and then consider the term of polarization),
you can see if you look a little bit closer on figure 2 that vectors E and B are
rotated for 90 degrees anticlockwise (or, you can also say rotated for Pi/2). We
now can finally define the term of polarization. You can say that the
electro-magnetic wave on figure 2 is polarized for 90 degrees (of course,
compared to our arbitrary polarization on figure 1). Even one photon, if we
consider particle side of light, can be polarized, why? Because, as I've
explained before, the light is booth particle and wave, and even one photon can
be considered also for wave (sorry, not further explanations for now...), and
you can also say that photon is polarized at some angle. When you use some light
source like bulb you have electro-magnetic waves of all possible angles of
polarizations. You can get especially polarized light&nbsp; at some angle with
the piece of equipment called <i>polarizator</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is only one term left to define, <i>phase
shift. </i>You could see on the picture above (one 3D picture) that function
that describe electro-magnetic wave really looks like wave. That is Sine
function, and you can see that is periodical function. Now I will tell you that
period of this function is 360 degrees or 2Pi. That 'periodical' means that the
function is repeating it's image after some value x. Look now on the picture bellow:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Phase.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see that the green and red functions are the same
one function, but shifted on the x axis. To be more precise i will say that
equation for red function is Sin(x) and equation for green function is Sin(x+Pi/4).
I can now say that green function is <i>phase shifted for Pi/4 (45 degrees)</i>
considering red function. Same thing is for electromagnetic wave because electromagnetic
wave is described with sine function (that is one of possible ways to describe
electromagnetic wave, but for purpose of this tutorial this is good enough).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>4) To those that are still with us...</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that are basic terms of physics needed for purpose of
further reading explained, we can now pass to the basic topic of this text, and
this is (in case you already forgot it by now) quantum cryptography and its
advantages compared to normal cryptography. This long beginning was not mainly
there in purpose of explanation of quantum cryptography itself, but in purpose
of explaining how the information is distributed.&nbsp; The main reason why
quantum crypto is so impressive is that there is used one of the fundamentals of
physics in very practical way.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's turn our eyes now on standard crypto systems,
because they are roots of quantum cryptography. We could define cryptography as
the art of hiding information in a string of bits that are meaningless to any
unauthorized party. To succeed in our task to hide information we usually use an
algorithm to combine <i>message</i> with some additional information that we usually
call <i><b>key</b></i> to produce <i><b>cryptogram</b></i>. This technique is
called <i><b>encryption</b></i>. Yeah, I know that most of you heard this story
before, but I must make things clear here, so have patience and you will be
rewarded, maybe. The thing you probably don't know if you are newbie into
cryptography and information theory is that person that encrypts is traditionally
called <i><b>Alice</b></i> and person that receives a message is traditionally
called <b><i>Bob </i></b>(that mainly stands for A and B). Just look at the
picture. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="NormalCryptoS.jpg"> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sympathy in this story goes to character that is traditionally called <i><b>Eve</b></i>.
That is the evil one, Eve stands for eavesdropper. As the word says that is the
one that intercepts the information that Alice sends to Bob. Eve is that
unauthorized, malevolent person we usually call cracker. As I've said before,
just look at the picture. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="NormalCrypto.jpg"> </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, now we have complete picture of problem that we are dealing
with. Public channel is usual channel we use to distribute information like
phone lines, optical cable, internet, maybe power lines in the recent future,
etc. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For any crypto-system to be secure, it should
be&nbsp; impossible to unlock cryptogram without Bob's key. This in practice is
softened to that the system is just extremely difficult to crack. The main idea
is that the message should remain protected as long as the information message
contain is valuable (that explain why is DES for instance, crackable at all).
Crypto-systems are divided in two main classes. This depends on wether key is
shared in secret or public. I will give you two examples, one for every group;
&quot;one-time&quot; pad and RSA, exposing their qualities, and disabilities. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

<h4 align="left">5) &quot;One-time&quot; pad vs. RSA in normal cryptography </h4>

<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;<i>One time&quot; pad</i> </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This system was proposed by Gilbert Vernam at
AT&amp;T in 1935 (quite old system, I must say), involve sharing a secret key
and is the only crypto-system that provides proven, perfect secrecy. In this
case Alice encrypts a message using a randomly generated key and then simply
adds each bit of the message to the corresponding bit of the key. The scrambled
message is then sent to Bob, who decrypts the message by subtracting the same
key. It can be seen below </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

</div>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, encrypted text doesn't contain any
information until you use key. Although perfectly secure, the problem with this
system is that is essential that Alice and Bob share common secret key, which
must be at least as long as the message itself. They can also use the key for
single encryption (that explains name 'one-time' pad), because if they used key
more than once Eve could record all of the scrambled messages and start to build
picture of the key. The real trouble starts here. If they want to share same
key, then key must be transmitted by some trusted means, such as courier or
through personal meeting between Alice and Bob. Yeah, now begins a story of
espionage... etc. I can think a couple of thousand problems here, ranging from
authentication problems, expensive meeting, eavesdropping, etc... I believe you
can think even more of them due it's 3am now that I'm writing this. It's same
with net, let me just mention IP-spoofing. Got it? I believe you do. The good
thing is that if Eve would like to crack message, not knowing the key, she would
have to try all combinations, and yet not knowing which was right. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>RSA
(Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RSA belongs to other class of crypto-systems,
so called <i>&quot;public-key crypto-systems&quot;</i>. First public-key
crypto-systems were proposed in 1976 by Whithfield Diffie and Martin Hellman who
were at Stanford University then. They used so called <i>one-way</i> functions
in which is easy to compute the function, for instance, f(x) (that means that we
have some function depending on some variable x) but they are hard to compute in
other way. In way to define what is meant by 'hard to compute in other way' we
can for instance take time as a factor, the good one crypto-system could be one
that a time to do a task grows exponentially with the number of bits used to
encrypt. For example we can take breaking number on prime factors. Let me show
it this way, you can work out that 109*59 is 6431, but it would take much longer
time to us to find out that the prime factors of 6431 are 59 and 109. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, some of these one way functions have
a so called &quot;trapdoor&quot;, which means there is easy way to compute
function in difficult direction with some additional information, in this case
key or password. So if you for instance know that one prime factor of 6431 is
59, it's not hard to calculate other prime factor. RSA is based on that function
I've explained above. It is believed today, but there is not any strong theory,
that the time needed to find prime factors of an integer, and to obtain private
key, grows exponentially with the number of input bits. There could be major
security hole here if someone finds out that there is faster way to calculate
prime factors, the problems are enlarging with the fact that the most money
transactions security systems are based on RSA. Hey... brakes here, lamer alarm
(only for those of you that need it) ... Don't think that you'll find out the
way to factorize prime numbers, and break into Wall-Street server in about 10
minutes, all with loud music causing brainstorm in you head (that looks like
that idiotic description of hackers, seen so often on media)... Generations of mathematicians
(and yes there are some much more intelligent than me and you together)
dedicated their careers to that task, and all this story draws it's roots from
Fermat I think, all back to 19-th century so... just don't blame yourself, ok.
If you wish to dedicate your lives to science, just forget that picture of
Albert Einstein developing his special theory of relativity for one long weekend
when his wife had PMS and the couldn't do anything else, OK? Hacking is science
and art, like mathematics or physics (and programming, off course), and it takes
long, long time, and great dedication. I'll pull water now, and continue this
topic... </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, what means public crypto-system at all.
Well that means that you with one key you make (pass that you type), you get two
keys, public and private. Looks like good bargain to me. You can share public
key with the all world, and they can encrypt message with it, but once the
message is encrypted only, and only the owner of private key can read it. Also,
when you send message that you've encrypted with private key (you keep it for
yourself, that's what that private means), that message will be decrypted with
public key, but the public key won't decrypt any message that are is not
encrypted with private key. That explains the term digital signature. No, you
can't compute private key having public key, at least not for some reasonable
time, considering, off course, that the other side choose hard password to
break. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are getting close to topic here. There is
one more reason (that is mostly the reason for having quantum cryptography as a
solution) why RSA could became unreliable in the future. There are devices, that
are only theory now (but good one, believe me, experiments say so), that are
called quantum computers (I'll write an essay on them too, very soon), that
could factorize numbers not exponentially, but linearly with number of bits. The
explanation is in, let us say, parallel processing that is even more parallel
than any other that exists now. Yeah, it sounds stupid, and maybe I'm stupid,
but I can't put the idea of quantum computing in one sentence. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>

<h4 align="left">6) The last (exit).... but not least </h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, as we could see, the public crypto-systems like RSA
could become useless in the future (don't worry, you'll be grandpas by that
time), with the appearances of the first useable quantum computers (boxes in
further text). You have one possible way, and yet the simplest one, to secretly
send a message. You can always turn to secret-key systems, such as Vernam's
system described above, if you have the way to perfectly hide the secret key
from Eve. This is the exactly the moment where quantum physics enters the
scene.. Bob and Alice must share a secret key (in opposite of public-key
systems), and quantum cryptography allows two physically separated parties to
create random secret key without resorting to the services of courier. What's
even better it also allows them to verify that the key has not been intercepted.
Quantum cryptography is not therefore a totally new crypto-system, but the
procedure to distribute the key in perfect secrecy from other parties like Eve (hehehehe).
So, let me put this I've just said in few words; quantum crypto is not crypto
algorithm, but it allow a key to be securely distributed and is consequently a
natural complement to Vernam's cipher.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="QuantumCryptoS.jpg"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To understand how quantum cryptography works we can
consider the &quot;BB84&quot; communication protocol, which was introduced in
1984 by Charles Bennett of IBM and Gilles Brassard from the University of
Montreal. Alice and Bob are connected by a quantum channel and a classical
public channel (see the picture above). If single photons are used to carry
information the quantum channel is usually optical fibre. The public channel,
however, can be any communication link, such as phone line or internet. Let us
stop now a little and say something about information. The information in
computer world is represented by series of 0's and 1's that assembled together
in defined order present information. That information can be anything numbers,
words, pictures, we only need to know how to interpret that binary information
(binary stands for there is information represented by series of 0 and 1, but
this is really out of topic so.... sorry I wasted eyes to those that well know
that, but I felt like saying it). Well, that 0 and 1 while traveling your phone
lines is represented like some voltage. Usually&nbsp; in the world of digital
electronics logical 0 and 1 are represented like 0V and 5V considering the
ground (sometimes -5V and 5V, and 0V can represent some other state). In the
case of quantum channel carriers are photons and as we could see we can use
polarization and phase shift.... can you dig it? Yes, we can define some
arbitrary angles of polarization or phase shift (well do you see now why was
that story so long). In practice, the public link is also optical fibre, with
both channels differing only in the intensity of light pulses. How this thing
work?</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="CrptoProcess.jpg" width="488" height="254"></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Alice has four polarizers, which can transmit,
which can transmit single photons polarized either vertically, horizontally, at
+45 degrees, or at -45 degrees (look at the picture above). She sends a series
of photons down the quantum channel, having chosen at random one of the
polarization states for each photon (which in this case represents key, also
note on pictures which polarization angles represent 0's and 1's, IT'S NOT
MISTAKE, and IT'S VERY IMPORTANT to note so you could understand process).</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Bob has four analyzers, not two (that are
devices that can analyze polarization angle, or several angles at one time, but
note, when you put analyzer and there is single photon, if you set analyzer at
some angle(s) you will be able only to see if the photon is polarized at that
angle(s) or not, also when you perform measure once you can't measure
polarization of the same photon again with other analyzer set to measure some
other angle(s), because once you measure, the information is destroyed by
measuring because of interaction of the measuring system and system you measure,
this is represented in physics by so called projection theorem, because you
project the measured system onto system that measures, huh sounds confusing..
yeah I've told you that about quantum mechanics, in other words this all means
you can't measure ALL angles at once). One analyzer allows Bob to distinguish
between photons polarized at +45 degrees and -45 degrees (see the picture
above), and other allows him to distinguish between horizontally and vertically
polarized photons. Note that Alice has four polarizers and Bob has only two
analyzers! Also note how are 0's and 1's set by Alice. That is crucial! What Bob
does then? Well, he randomly chose one analyzer and uses it to record each
photon. He now writes down which analyzer he used and what it recorded (if he
chose wrong analyzer, he won't get any information about the state of photon, in
case you forgot, polarization is one of states of photon). For example, if Alice
sent a vertically polarized photon and Bob chose to detect photons at +/-45
degrees. Basically if Bob chose +/-45 degrees analyzer there is 50% chance that
he will record something, elementary my dear Watson. Even if Bob finds out later
that he chose the wrong analyzer, he will have no way of finding out which
polarization state Alice sent.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, after exchanging enough photons, Bob announces on
the public channel the sequence of analyzers he used, <b>but not the results he
obtained</b>.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, Alice compares this sequence with the list of
bits she originally sent, and tells Bob on the public channel on which occasions
his analyzer was compatible with the photon's polarization. She <b>does not tell
him which polarization states she sent</b>. If Bob used an analyzer that was not
compatible with Alice's photon, bit is simply discarded. For the bits that
remain (look at the retained bit sequence at picture), Alice an Bob know that
they have the same values - provided that the eavesdropper didn't perturb the
transmission. The <b>bits that are left</b> Alice and Bob can use to <b>generate
key</b> that they will use to encrypt the message they will send then by public
channel. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="QuantumCrypto.jpg"> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now see the case when there is Eve. Suppose the Eve
has intercepted both quantum and Public channel (suppose Eve cut the fibre and
she set her equipment), and of course, she sends information to Bob so her
eavesdropping couldn't be noticed. What's wrong with that picture in this case?
Obviously, the disclosed bits cannot be used for encryption anymore. If Eve
intercepted their key, the correlation between the values of their bits will
have been reduced. For example if Eve had the same equipment like Bob and cuts
fibre and measures signal, she will always get random bit whenever she chooses
wrong analyzers (that is statistically 50% of all cases). But having intercepted
the signal Eve still has to send a photon to Bob to cover her tracks. Therefore,
in 50% of cases Alice's and Bob's analyzers match, but what's in case that Eve
didn't used a right analyzer and that is in 50% of cases? However in half of
these cases photon will accidentally pass through the right analyzer at Bob's
side. We can see now that correlation between Alice's and Bob's measures will
drop to only 25% in presence of Eve. In that case Alice and Bob will know that
information has been intercepted, when they compare keys over public link they
will see a greater disagreement (to be more precise, twice greater) and they
will drop transmission. Simple isn't it? </p>

<h4><b>7) Quantum cryptography in real life</b> </h4>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how you can achieve quantum cryptography in practice?
Photons are good candidates to carry information, they are easy to produce and
to measure. Story I've presented for polarization can be used same for phase
shift. In fact, it's more used than polarization. What's even better they can be
transmitted through the optical fibre and over last 25 years attenuation of
light (measure of how much photons are lost during transmission) at wavelenght
of 1300nm has been reduced from several decibels per metre to just 0.35 decibels
per kilometre. This means that photons can travel up to 10km before 50% of them
are lost which is sufficient to perform quantum cryptography in local networks.
Some of you with more technical education could note that you could use an
amplifier to transmit photons, but amplifiers cannot be used because quantum
states cannot be copies (in some cases yes, in case of quantum teleportation,
but this is not that case). There are also some projects aiming to establish
quantum communication from a satellite down to earth or other satellite, but as
far as I know this is not yet practice. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not only problem. There is always
trouble with quality of link. Uncorrelated bits may originate from several
experimental imperfections. First, Alice has to ensure that she creates photons
that are exactly the states she choose. If, for instance, a vertical photon is
incorrectly polarized at an angle 84 degrees, there is only 1% possibility that
Bob will find in channel for horizontally polarized photons. Similar problem is
from Bob's side; does he measure exactly 90 degrees. Another difficulty is
ensuring that the encoded bits are maintained during transmission. There is also
one more problem, due to the birefringence of the fibre, the polarization states
received by Bob will, in general, be different from those sent by Alice, and
that also asks for calibration of their apparatus, etc. etc. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To overcome these problems, Alice and Bob have to apply a
classical error-correction algorithm to their data so that they can reduce the
errors below an error rate of 10^(-9) (0.000000001 or one in billion) - the
industry standard for digital telecommunications. And since they cannot be sure
if the presence of of uncorrelated bits was due to the poor performance of their
set-up or to an eavesdropper, they have to assume the worst-case scenario - that
all the errors were caused by Eve. There is one procedure Alice and Bob may use
known as &quot;privacy amplification&quot; in which several bits are combined
into one. This procedure ensures that the combined bits correlate only if Alice
and Bob's initial bits are the same. The problem with privacy amplification is
that it shortens the key length a lot and it's only possible up to certain
error. That means that Alice and Bob have to be careful to introduce as few
errors as possible when they initially send their quantum bits. </p>

<h4>8) Last words </h4>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tradition of a dying tutorial I must now say something
to close this text. Well you've now been introduced to one of new technologies
that are now used. Don get caught in web... Port 80 is not only thing in
communications today, like the phone lines also aren't all. Optical communication
has been used for some 20 years, and today not only for T1 backbones. There are
some other technologies that go parallel with quantum cryptography, like quantum
computing and quantum teleportation that I will also present to you soon. I hope
that you've liked this tutorial and I hope I've make it readable. Don't be lazy
read it few times if you don't catch me (no, not because it's my tutorial)
because it's confusing and hard topic. I'll appreciate any comments and suggestions,
and feel free to ask me any question if you have it about quantum technology.
You have my mail. Thank you for your time... </p>
