<br>[15:12] &lt;Mind_Booster> Hi all...

<br>[15:13] &lt;+Mind_Booster> as I was saying...
<br>[15:14] &lt;+Mind_Booster> The log of this lecture will be on bsrf
(http://blacksun.box.sk)
<br>[15:14] &lt;+Mind_Booster> and in Mind Booster Networks (http://mindbooster.cjb.net).
<br>[15:14] &lt;+Mind_Booster> This lecture has the duration of 30 minutes:
<br>[15:14] &lt;+Mind_Booster> 20 minutes for exposure and
<br>[15:14] &lt;+Mind_Booster> 10 minutes for feedback: questions, answers
and so on.
<br>[15:14] &lt;+Mind_Booster> As there's time scheduled for Questions,
please don't pvt me: I'll not answer unless you're an #bsrf op.
<br>[15:15] &lt;+Mind_Booster> The title of this lecture is:
<br>[15:15] &lt;+Mind_Booster> -- Informatic Evolution --
<br>[15:15] &lt;+Mind_Booster> In my oppinion it's important to know and
understand the evolution of Informatic.
<br>[15:15] &lt;+Mind_Booster> I miss BBS's times.
<br>[15:15] &lt;+Mind_Booster> As maybe you miss somethings you used to
do.

<br>[15:15] &lt;+Mind_Booster> You may miss something you usually did,
<br>[15:15] &lt;+Mind_Booster> like a Spectrum game
<br>[15:16] -Global- lecture on information evolution in #bsrf now
<br>[15:16] &lt;+Mind_Booster> or a friend you had somewhere...
<br>[15:16] &lt;+Mind_Booster> But we have to understand that those times
will never come back.
<br>[15:16] *** BaRrAcU (ZeRo@BOX-256.telepac.pt) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:16] &lt;+Mind_Booster> But it's our duty to turn these and next
times to something with the good things the old times had.
<br>[15:16] *** HcC (heh@24.78.4.BOX-3548) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:16] &lt;+Mind_Booster> That's the why of this lecture:
<br>[15:16] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Not to teach you nothing,
<br>[15:16] &lt;+Mind_Booster> not to warn you of something,
<br>[15:17] &lt;+Mind_Booster> only to make you see a point.
<br>[15:17] &lt;+Mind_Booster> I'm seeing a lot of Portuguese ppl (as myself)
here: Thank you for comming.
<br>[15:17] &lt;+Mind_Booster> What's Informatic Evolution?
<br>[15:17] &lt;+Mind_Booster> See this log:
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> [19:09]&lt;( Qauzar )hey whats informaric
evolution ?
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> [19:10]&lt;@ AZTEK >ask Mind_Booster
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> [19:12] &lt;Mind_Booster> The lecture will
be some talking about the way Informatic Communities were
<br>created, evoluting, and to see the point on that now. Because it's
important to know the past to understand the present and
<br>build the future.
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> So... how will I expose this evolution?
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Nothing better than showing a chronologic
type of history on Computers and Underground communities.
<br>[15:18] *** Road^K|ll (Road@BOX-23720.aol.com) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Where to start?
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Maybe I should start on Abacus - after all
it was the first Computer in mankind's history.
<br>[15:18] &lt;+Mind_Booster> But for that, I would have to talk about,
filosofy, religion, maths, fisics and so on
<br>[15:19] *** aligatu (aligatu@213.233.63.BOX-3394) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:19] &lt;+Mind_Booster> just 'cause they all are the reason why
Computers exist in the first place.
<br>[15:19] &lt;+Mind_Booster> So I decided to start in 1946, when John
W. Mauchly and Eckert first invented ENIAC.
<br>[15:19] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Why stating here?
<br>[15:19] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Well, this is the beggining of the Underground
scene.
<br>[15:19] *** Qauzar (sdf@BOX-4975.co.za) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:19] -Global- lecture on information evolution in #bsrf now
<br>[15:20] &lt;+Mind_Booster> With ENIAC the concept of having fun with
a computer was born.
<br>[15:20] *** Prophecy (Name@BOX-23784.aol.com) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:20] &lt;+Mind_Booster> People (usually physics/engeneers) started
to develop and use software just for fun.
<br>[15:20] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Code to ENIAC was only FORTRAN, assembly
or some other - now dead - languages.
<br>[15:20] *** Matt sets mode: -o Matt
<br>[15:20] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Those few who loved ENIAC started forming
(inconsciously) a sub-culture, a society.

evoluting more and more quickly.

<br>[15:22] &lt;+Mind_Booster> Why?
<br>[15:22] &lt;+Mind_Booster> This is the date when MIT bought it's 1st
PDP-1. (a Hell of a machine! :))
<br>[15:22] &lt;+Mind_Booster> A new - renovated - community was created,
<br>[15:23] &lt;+Mind_Booster> and it was the 1st time that the "hacker"
term was used.
<br>[15:23] &lt;+Mind_Booster> It's sad to see nowadays lammers calaiming
they are hackers,
<br>[15:23] &lt;+Mind_Booster> or media confusing cracking or worst, carding,
with hacking,

<br>[15:25] &lt;@Mind_Booster> "Two Russian hackers were arrested by using
fake credt cards to steal a bank"

they are hackers, without doing anything wrong,

<br>[15:26] &lt;@Mind_Booster> because society cunfuses Hacking with some
crime.
<br>[15:26] &lt;@Mind_Booster> But back into time...
<br>[15:26] &lt;@Mind_Booster> In 1969 those hackers influence were spreaded
widly: ARPANET was created.
<br>[15:27] &lt;@Mind_Booster> ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency
Network), from U.S. Department of Defense,
<br>[15:27] &lt;@Mind_Booster> was the global Internet's progenitor.
<br>[15:27] &lt;@Mind_Booster> ARPANET program has had a strong and direct
feedback into the support and strength of computer science,
<br>[15:27] *** poet_solitaire (oioem@195.94.60.BOX-26980) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:27] &lt;@Mind_Booster> from which the network itself sprung.
<br>[15:28] &lt;@Mind_Booster> A climate of pure research surrounded the
entire history of the ARPANET.
<br>[15:28] &lt;@Mind_Booster> The Advanced Research Projects Agency was
formed with an emphasis towards research,
<br>[15:28] &lt;@Mind_Booster> and thus was not oriented only to a military
product.

<br>[15:28] &lt;@Mind_Booster> The formation of this agency was part of
the U.S. reaction to the then Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik
<br>in 1957.
<br>[15:29] &lt;@Mind_Booster> ARPA was assigned to research how to utilize
their investment in computers via Command and Control
<br>Research (CCR).
<br>[15:29] &lt;@Mind_Booster> Dr. J.C.R. Licklider was chosen to head
this effort.
<br>[15:29] *** sensenet (arokh@BOX-19315.globcom.net) has joined #bsrf
<br>[15:29] &lt;@Mind_Booster> Licklider came to ARPA from Bolt, Beranek
and Newman, (BBN) in Cambridge, MA in October 1962.
<br>[15:29] &lt;@Mind_Booster> ARPANET is still not dead, even if it was
engulfed by INTERNET.
<br>[15:30] &lt;@Mind_Booster> You can still telnet sdf.lonestar.org and
see a now completely different ARPANET, nut rellued by the same
<br>those who were ARPANET users then.

<br>[15:31] &lt;@Mind_Booster> ARPANET made something - in my point - spread
to all US and the world a nrew philosophy:
<br>[15:31] &lt;@Mind_Booster> There was a spread of hackers all over U.S.
<br>[15:31] &lt;@Mind_Booster> and in some other countries, with a good
point to Australia
<br>[15:31] &lt;@Mind_Booster> .

of Micro-computers

<br>[15:46] &lt;JH> and out of all the *nix variants its the best desktop
OS
<br>[15:46] *** kakun_ (mruser@BOX-9608.org.il) has left #bsrf
<br>[15:46] &lt;HcC> ms linux
<br>[15:46] &lt;HcC> hehe
<br>[15:46] &lt;PolyGnoM> i dont understand why you people say windows
is a gaming os, or just for newbie users
<br>[15:47] &lt;PolyGnoM> thats not true at all
<br>[15:47] &lt;HcC> poly
<br>[15:47] &lt;PolyGnoM> take winNT
<br>[15:47] &lt;PolyGnoM> the 2k, XP variants
<br>[15:47] &lt;suspect> Considering most Games were designed for windows
<br>[15:47] &lt;suspect> heh
<br>[15:47] &lt;HcC> take windows 98
<br>[15:47] &lt;HcC> what gamer doesn't have windows 98
<br>[15:47] &lt;@zwanderer> Mind_Booster: depends... depends where you
want this whole thing to do... its views like yours that actually
<br>restrict technology... the fact that you and others advocate that people
should install Linux themselves, and everyone should
<br>stop using M"$" products, is restricting, and isnt helping... neither
is this lecture realy
<br>[15:47] &lt;suspect> Take 2k..ewww BABy Yeahhhh
<br>[15:47] &lt;PolyGnoM> ever attempted to read just one technical reference
for lets say win2k???
<br>[15:47] *** Shade (na@BOX-284.skynet.be) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<br>[15:47] &lt;suspect> ya'll want suma that heh
<br>[15:48] &lt;JH> i think the speed at which linux apps are developping
must worry m$
<br>[15:48] &lt;HcC> I'm sorry but until theres a good gaming distro of
linux thats compatable with everything I'll have windows on 1 of
<br>my machines
<br>[15:48] &lt;SOAD> suspect: what's wrong w/ 2k? It is defenitely more
network control oriented
<br>[15:48] &lt;JH> take gnome for example, 1 and 1/2 years ago it was
unusable, now it has most gui features windows does
<br>[15:48] &lt;suspect> SOAD, *err* *err* im Worshipping 2k for the stability
man.
<br>[15:49] &lt;SOAD> suspect: ahh lol
<br>[15:49] &lt;suspect> (my Copy's Never Crashed)
<br>[15:49] &lt;HcC> samers
<br>[15:49] &lt;PolyGnoM> heh guys, winNT has possibilities you dont even
dream of
<br>[15:49] &lt;SOAD> suspect: install some more hardware you might find
otherwise
<br>[15:49] &lt;@Mind_Booster> Sorry people, I had to go to pvt, any question
I didn't answer yet?
<br>[15:49] &lt;@zwanderer> pfft
<br>[15:49] &lt;suspect> SOAD, Yeah I dont have any hardware..none!
<br>[15:49] &lt;@zwanderer> fuck it
<br>[15:50] &lt;JH> Mind_Booster: did you mean a battle between Unix
and VMS? you said Vax
<br>[15:50] &lt;PolyGnoM> pointless anyways this convo
<br>[15:50] *** Mikkkeee sets mode: +o cube
<br>[15:50] &lt;HcC> hows it goin mikkkeee?
<br>[15:50] &lt;@zwanderer> PolyGnoM: aye..
<br>[15:50] &lt;PolyGnoM> :-)
<br>[15:50] &lt;HcC> :)
<br>[15:51] &lt;SOAD> suspect: I've tested 2k by installing lots of different
hardware and I can make it 'crash-prone'
<br>[15:51] &lt;@Mind_Booster> JH: Yes, you're right.
<br>[15:51] &lt;suspect> SOAD, thats nice.
<br>[15:51] &lt;HcC> anyway I think basically the whole windows linux battle
will never be truly won because ppl have their own
<br>preferences.
<br>[15:51] &lt;JH> i think there is probably a linux port for vax
<br>[15:51] &lt;@Mind_Booster> But UNIX and VAX was the center of the Hack
culture
<br>[15:51] &lt;SOAD> suspect: heh just pointing out it's not perfect
<br>[15:52] &lt;PolyGnoM> "hack culture" - maaaaaaaaaaaaaaan
<br>[15:52] &lt;suspect> SOAD..Unlike You, I dont TRY and crash my OS.
<br>[15:52] &lt;@Mind_Booster> and there were some "wars" between fans
of one and other
<br>[15:52] &lt;PolyGnoM> tzzz
<br>[15:52] &lt;suspect> :)
<br>[15:52] &lt;@Mind_Booster> just as later
<br>[15:52] * SOAD laughs
<br>[15:52] &lt;@Mind_Booster> with PC vs. AMIGA
<br>[15:52] &lt;@Mind_Booster> or soething like that :)
<br>[15:52] &lt;JH> anyone tried running linux on an amiga?
<br>[15:53] &lt;PolyGnoM> lol - silence
<br>[15:54] &lt;SOAD> JH: nope
<br>[15:54] &lt;JH> i think i'll try that tonight
<br>[15:54] &lt;Neophyte> lol
<br>[15:54] &lt;@Mind_Booster> HcC: But is stupid to have an OS that
burns at least a 233MMX and 1Gb hard-disk for it's instalation...
<br>Just to point the beggining of it all, I could just start complaining
(and spend some hoursr on it) about the installation of
<br>Windoze!
<br>[15:55] &lt;PolyGnoM> this comment is crappy Mind_Booster
<br>[15:55] &lt;@Mind_Booster> JH: You can get it but take it ease: dependidng
on your AMIGA you may have to flash it all!
<br>[15:55] &lt;SOAD> Mind_Booster: you forgetting the fact about the expansion
of CPU speed and the drop in price per gigabyte
<br>[15:55] &lt;SOAD> erm you're
<br>[15:56] &lt;JH> bbl
<br>[15:56] &lt;HcC> lol
<br>[15:56] &lt;HcC> mindbooster
<br>[15:56] *** LiquidCrystalDismay (NNN@BOX-17520.net.nz) Quit (Quit:
)
<br>[15:56] &lt;HcC> I've gone over this a million times
<br>[15:56] &lt;@Mind_Booster> PolyGnoM: Well, I can't just forgive an
OS that forces me to occupy 1Gb of disk just to have it running!
<br>[15:56] &lt;HcC> nobody wins the battle
<br>[15:56] &lt;suspect> doh
<br>[15:56] &lt;SOAD> lol most likely not
<br>[15:56] &lt;@Mind_Booster> Well, my point is: fight.
<br>[15:57] &lt;SOAD> this is like arguing over religion
<br>[15:57] &lt;suspect> These days You dont pay so much per gig, You pay
for the labour
<br>[15:57] &lt;HcC> heh
<br>[15:57] &lt;@Mind_Booster> Well, I guess noone has more questions so...
<br>[15:57] &lt;HcC> I'm not religious
<br>[15:57] &lt;HcC> :P
<br>[15:57] &lt;suspect> so I dont mind giving 2 gigs to linux - np.
