<P>&lt;sts|> a zip ???
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> guys the lecture started?
<BR>&lt;Hijack> 5k
<BR>&lt;mezzano> it's mikkkeee sup man told you I wouldn't miss this one
;)
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> around 5k
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> not large at all
<BR>&lt;Syrup> anyone know how juno password algorithm works?
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> small
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> guys the lecture started?
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> not yet Mikkkeee
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> just told everyone to download the file
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +v unknown
<BR>&lt;unknown> No it starts now
<BR>&lt;Revelant-Angel> i can read anything all messages are flying passed
me
<BR>*** Retrieving #bsrf info...
<BR>*** Revelant-Angel has quit IRC (Quit:)
<BR>&lt;feds> what is it???
<BR>&lt;Syrup> yay lecture
<BR>*** DarkneSs has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> its a zip unknown set up
<BR>*** bulgarinche has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> http://blacksun.box.sk/mirror/LKM.zip
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> i dunno what LKM even is
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> loadable kernel modules
<BR>&lt;unknown> I will explain every thing
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> don't get excited kids!
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> :)
<BR>&lt;feds> hey
<BR>&lt;feds> me 2!
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> well someone log this too
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> LKM = Loadable Kernel Module
<BR>*** optimum has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> is this lecture aplicable to even beginners
<BR>* freakOVER is loggin
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ;)
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> i'm logging Mikkkeee
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> i'm a beginner beginner
<BR>&lt;Dustin> obviously
<BR>*** wascy has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> ---------beginning of lecture---------------
<BR>&lt;feds> any other celeb like u
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> if anyone wants voice msg an op
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK lets start
<BR>&lt;ControlC> SWEET
<BR>*** _jacs- is now known as jacs
<BR>&lt;D|GiTaLM0nKe3> k
<BR>&lt;wascy> me, pls.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> wait who wants voice
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> do we need a c compiler? theres a c file in that
zip
<BR>&lt;sts|> wich kernelversion?
<BR>&lt;sts|> 2.2 2.4?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> i owuld like voice
<BR>&lt;D|GiTaLM0nKe3> I do
<BR>&lt;twix> me
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> i want voice
<BR>&lt;|StYxX|> no one talk for a sec
<BR>&lt;wascy> i'd like. thx.
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ouch
<BR>&lt;snider> }{exadecimal: If you use linux you have gcc, if you don't
use linux the LKM won't compile anyways
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +v Phr3k
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> you need GCC
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> unknown you can begin
<BR>&lt;unknown> LKM(loadable kernel modules) are used to increase
<BR>&lt;unknown> the kernel's functionality on run time.
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +v mezzano
<BR>&lt;unknown> which means you dont have to recompile the entire kernel
to
<BR>&lt;unknown> use load it.
<BR>&lt;unknown> This is why it is used for many device drivers.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Because LKM are used as part of the kernel it
<BR>&lt;unknown> give us endless ways to use it for our benifits :)
<BR>*** SpiderMan has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> are LKMs slower to load?
<BR>*** SpiderMan has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: +o SpiderMan
<BR>&lt;unknown> Every LKM contains 2 main functions
<BR>*** h4x0r3d has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown>&nbsp; int init_module(void) and cleanup_module
<BR>*** jacs has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** _sokrates- has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<BR>&lt;unknown> init_module is called when the module is loaded and cleanup_module
<BR>&lt;unknown> is called when you remove it. init_module should return
0
<BR>&lt;unknown> to signal that everything is OK.
<BR>&lt;unknown> e also must define MODULE and include linux/module.h for
<BR>&lt;unknown> module configurations,definitions,macros etc.
<BR>*** Phish has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> o now we can code our first helloworld LKM
<BR>&lt;unknown> look at helloworld.c see of you understand everything.
<BR>&lt;unknown> (it should be easy).
<BR>&lt;unknown> If u wonder why i used printk and not printf its
<BR>&lt;unknown> because we are running in kernel mode which
<BR>&lt;unknown> means we can use restricted set of functions
<BR>&lt;unknown> A list of useful funcs is in func_list.txt.
<BR>*** D|GiTaLM0nKe3 has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> questions ?
<BR>*** snider sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;mezzano> that was deep ;)
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ya
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> are LKMs slower to load up than if u just compiled the
kernel with them?
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> hey it's just a question :P
<BR>&lt;unknown> You load it into lernel space in run-time
<BR>&lt;snider> feds: i'll send the files
<BR>&lt;sts|> you load them.. then they run like they were compiled into
the kernel
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ah ok
<BR>&lt;feds> i have them
<BR>&lt;Hijack> passwords can be captured using the LKM
<BR>&lt;unknown> Yes
<BR>&lt;Hijack> have them sent through e-mail
<BR>&lt;unknown> you can do almost everything using LKM
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> so how do we use the lkm?
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK
<BR>&lt;feds> it says it can't find DEVCPP.exe
<BR>&lt;unknown> So let continue
<BR>&lt;suspect> lol
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> unknown would these files run as vxd files?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> unknown: but they would need to RUN your lkm first to steal
passes?
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> feds: just open it up in notepad for now
<BR>&lt;unknown> So lets continue
<BR>*** snider sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> feds: open it using notepad
<BR>&lt;unknown> You can also hack the sever and load it yourself
<BR>&lt;unknown> It almost like VxD but in linux
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> are you going to give us an example in real time?
<BR>&lt;unknown> Yes
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> man vxd hacking is hot
<BR>*** Dustin has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> So compile helloworld.c with gcc -O3 -c helloworld.c
<BR>*** pitpat has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> This will create helloworld.o
<BR>*** Syrup has quit IRC (Quit:)
<BR>&lt;unknown> to insert the LKM do "insmod helloworld.o"
<BR>*** dg-2 has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;unknown> Now do lsmod
<BR>&lt;unknown> this will list the modules loaded into the kernel
<BR>&lt;unknown> Later we will see how to make our LKM
<BR>&lt;unknown> Unremovabe &amp; invisible
<BR>&lt;unknown> to remove it do "rmmod helloworld"
<BR>&lt;unknown> questions?
<BR>*** DG-2 has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> questions?
<BR>&lt;mezzano> nope seems pretty intuitive ;)
<BR>&lt;unknown> KO
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK
<BR>*** SpiderMan sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;Hijack> so is there any solutions for removing it if i were a system
admin
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> no voice
<BR>&lt;Hijack> ?
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK now because our LKM is running in kernel space
<BR>&lt;unknown> we cant access user space memory.
<BR>&lt;unknown> So lets say one of our functions gets as
<BR>&lt;unknown> an argument a pointer to user space
<BR>&lt;unknown> we must move it to kernel space before we try
<BR>&lt;unknown> to use data it points to.
<BR>&lt;_miketr0nix-> hello
<BR>*** SpiderMan sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> to use data it points to.
<BR>&lt;unknown> He can remove it on run-time he can restart the box
<BR>&lt;unknown> so the module will not be loaded
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +o unknown
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: -o unknown
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> shit
<BR>&lt;unknown> but first he has to find it
<BR>* mezzano thinks mikkkeee needs to pimp-slap chanserv ;)
<BR>&lt;unknown> If you what you can put some script to insmod it when
the box starts
<BR>&lt;unknown> In order to move user data to ke rnel data we have several
functions
<BR>*** ControlC has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;unknown> get_user(kernel_dest,user_pointer) - gets the value user_pointer
points to
<BR>&lt;unknown> and put it in kernel_dest(old kernels use dest=get_user(src)).
<BR>&lt;unknown> put_user(kernel_src,user_pointer) - note that kernel_src
<BR>&lt;unknown> is not a pointer)
<BR>&lt;unknown> copy_from_user(kernel_dest_ptr,src_ptr,size)
<BR>&lt;unknown> copy_to_user(user_dest_ptr,src_ptr,size)
<BR>*** DG-2 has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<BR>*** pitpat has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +o unknown
<BR>*** optimum has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> For example look at _h_lkm.c at line 78
<BR>*** suspect has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;unknown> this function copies string from user
<BR>*** Dustin has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> (GET_U is a macro for get_user())
<BR>&lt;unknown> questions ?
<BR>*** [phRoZen] has joined #BSRF
<BR>*** SpiderMan sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;Hijack> none at the moment
<BR>*** optimum is now known as optimum[d
<BR>&lt;Neophyte> im fine
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> yeah
<BR>*** zaxil has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;zaxil> hey everyone
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> why do we keep losing our voices?
<BR>*** bulgarinche has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK lets continue
<BR>&lt;Neophyte> he sets moderation
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> cause you interupt
<BR>*** optimum[d is now known as optimum[downloading]
<BR>&lt;i-o> the printk, where can i see it??
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> i know what he does but why
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> Moving on to symbol table.
<BR>&lt;unknown> The symbol table is a file found in /proc/ksyms which
contains exported
<BR>&lt;unknown> kernel symbols(functions for example) that can be used
<BR>&lt;unknown> by our LKM and kernel.
<BR>&lt;unknown> The reason we should care about this file is that it will
also contain
<BR>&lt;unknown> our LKM functions so a good admin will be able to spot
<BR>&lt;unknown> our LKM. It can also be used by us to spot and admin LKM
<BR>*** Drager has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;unknown> If he monitors the entire system with some super LKM
<BR>&lt;unknown>&nbsp; we should reconsider our actions).
<BR>&lt;unknown> BTW If you encounter and detect this kind of LKM try
<BR>&lt;unknown> to DoS the machine and make it restart many admins
<BR>&lt;unknown> dont activate the LKM's on init.
<BR>*** count_chocula has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> Anyway to control the exported symbols all have to do
is to
<BR>&lt;unknown> is to use macros defined in module.h (in old kernel
<BR>&lt;unknown> we need to include /linux/symtab_begin.h and
<BR>&lt;unknown> use register_symtab(NULL) if we dont want to
<BR>&lt;unknown> export symbols).
<BR>*** _Altus- has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> The macros are 'EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS' if dont want to export
<BR>&lt;unknown> symbols.
<BR>&lt;unknown> If we want to export something define EXPORT_SYMTAB
<BR>&lt;unknown> and use 'EXPORT_SYMBOL(name)' macro.
<BR>&lt;unknown> questions?
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;feds> is it works on win kernel?
<BR>&lt;unknown> No
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> no
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> no, for windows use VxDs
<BR>&lt;feds> dam
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> vxds can be discovered
<BR>&lt;feds> where do i get it?
<BR>&lt;mezzano> strictly *nix baby ;)
<BR>&lt;Hijack> the same manner can be applied in window s vxds
<BR>&lt;Dustin> vxd == lkm for win?
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK lets continue
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> yah
<BR>&lt;Hijack> yes , very true
<BR>&lt;feds> where can i get it?
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> Now the interesting part - system calls
<BR>&lt;unknown> Every OS has built in functions that are used for every
operation
<BR>&lt;unknown> on the system in linux those functions are called system
calls.
<BR>&lt;unknown> So if we control the system calls we can control the entire
<BR>&lt;unknown> system.
<BR>&lt;unknown> To see a list of all the system calls look in
<BR>&lt;unknown> look in /usr/include/bits/syscall.h(or run a search for
<BR>&lt;unknown> syscall.h).
<BR>&lt;unknown> so lets say we want to find which system call
<BR>&lt;unknown> is used to list files(which system call is used by ls).
<BR>&lt;unknown> Do 'strace ls'.
<BR>&lt;unknown> strace will give you all the system calls used by ls.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Most of the functions are obvious and many repeat many
times
<BR>&lt;unknown> but look at getdents it shows only twice and the second
<BR>&lt;unknown> argument stats "* entries" if you check this is
<BR>&lt;unknown> the number of files + folders + hidden files
<BR>&lt;unknown> in the folder.
<BR>&lt;unknown> * is a number
<BR>&lt;unknown> So we can assume that this is the system call.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Now the next step is to try to 'man getdents'.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Getdents has manual entry so it explains what it
<BR>&lt;unknown> does and we were right :)
<BR>*** Norton has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> If there isnt man entry you can search the kernel sources
<BR>&lt;unknown> (you should always search the sources to see how something
works
<BR>&lt;unknown>&nbsp; before replacing it).
<BR>&lt;unknown> Next we will replace it and modify it to hide every file
or folder
<BR>&lt;unknown> that starts with _h_.
<BR>&lt;unknown> questions?
<BR>*** SpiderMan sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;_miketr0nix-> hi
<BR>&lt;Dustin> yes
<BR>&lt;_miketr0nix-> i have a question
<BR>&lt;Dustin> getdents is a program like strace?
<BR>*** XarZ has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;_miketr0nix-> i want to know things about how to stop my ping
<BR>&lt;unknown> getdents is a system call
<BR>&lt;_miketr0nix-> but i am in windows
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> stop your ping?
<BR>&lt;_miketr0nix-> yes
<BR>&lt;zaxil> get a firewall to blok them
<BR>&lt;_miketr0nix-> like someone is trying to ping me
<BR>&lt;Dustin> lets save this for another time, shall we?
<BR>&lt;unknown> strace can be used to out which functions are used
<BR>*** _miketr0nix- has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;Norton> heh
<BR>&lt;unknown> strace can be used to fing out which functions are used
<BR>&lt;Hijack> unknown
<BR>*** fatboyjoe has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;snider> i have a q..
<BR>&lt;unknown> by a program
<BR>&lt;Dustin> then what is getdents for
<BR>&lt;Hijack> one question before i leave , which is not related to LKM
<BR>&lt;unknown> getdents is used to get a list of files and folder from
<BR>&lt;unknown> a directory
<BR>&lt;unknown> ls uses it to get its data
<BR>&lt;snider> unknown: i use kernel 2.4.1 which is too old to load that
helloworld module.. how come? how can the system see that its been written
for a newer kernel version?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> oh ls uses a syscall called 'getdents'?
<BR>&lt;Hijack>&nbsp; will the topic ACK Tunnelling be brought up in future
lectures?
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> yah
<BR>*** zaxil has quit IRC (Quit:)
<BR>&lt;unknown> Dustin: yes
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ok, it becomes clear
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> hijack maybe in the later weeks
<BR>&lt;unknown> So if we will replace getdents system call we can hide
files
<BR>&lt;Hijack> thanks mikkkeee , it s the seccond attack which i fear
most behind LKM / VxD hacking
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> hehe ack tunneling
<BR>*** _fatboyjoe- has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>*** Hijack has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;unknown> and process (since processes are listed in /proc)
<BR>&lt;unknown> and processes (since processes are listed in /proc)
<BR>&lt;h4x0r3d> heh
<BR>&lt;unknown> So lets continue
<BR>&lt;Dustin> oh, so getdents() could be programmed to leave out files
that begin in !
<BR>&lt;unknown> yes
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ok, plz continue
<BR>&lt;unknown> thats our purpose
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> To intercept system calls you need to know that the kernel
<BR>&lt;unknown> exports a table that lists all the system calls.
<BR>&lt;unknown> The var is 'void *sys_call_table[]'.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Each entry in this array is a pointer to a system call.
<BR>&lt;unknown> You can look in syscall.h to find its number.
<BR>&lt;unknown> So if we want to replace getdents system call we can
<BR>&lt;unknown> use this code:
<BR>&lt;unknown> ...
<BR>&lt;unknown> extern void *sys_call_table[];
<BR>&lt;unknown> int (*o_getdents)(unsigned int,struct dirent *,unsigned
int);
<BR>&lt;unknown> int h_getdents("same vars"){
<BR>&lt;unknown>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your code
<BR>&lt;unknown> }
<BR>&lt;unknown> ...
<BR>&lt;unknown> int init_module(){
<BR>&lt;unknown> ...
<BR>&lt;unknown> o_getdents = sys_call_table[SYS_getdents];
<BR>&lt;unknown> sys_call_table[SYS_getdents] = h_getdents;
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> excellent
<BR>&lt;unknown> ...
<BR>&lt;unknown> }
<BR>&lt;unknown> void cleanup_module(){
<BR>&lt;unknown> ...
<BR>&lt;unknown> sys_call_table[SYS_getdents] = o_getdents;
<BR>&lt;unknown> ...
<BR>&lt;unknown> }
<BR>&lt;unknown> We need to save the original system call because we might
<BR>&lt;unknown> use it and because we need to restore it when
<BR>&lt;unknown> we remove the module (unless ou want to fuck up the system
<BR>&lt;unknown> Questions?
<BR>*** SpiderMan sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;mezzano> so after loading this LKM then all susequent file listing
requests would exclude those we don't want them to see then correct?
<BR>&lt;unknown> Yes if code it properly
<BR>&lt;unknown> Yes if u code it properly
<BR>&lt;Dustin> this is all well and good, but wouldnt you need root access
to load a lkm?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> and if you had root whqats the point
<BR>&lt;snider> what is the purpose of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o_getdents = sys_call_table[SYS_getdents];&nbsp;
?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> of going thru all the trouble
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> well if u had gotten into a system
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> for like
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> a backdoor
<BR>&lt;unknown> Dustin: Lets say you want to put a sniffer
<BR>&lt;snider> oh.. nevermind me
<BR>&lt;unknown> on the system and make it totaly invisible
<BR>*** JamesBONG has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ok point taken
<BR>&lt;Dustin> oyu cant to that with a program cause a task mgr would
list it
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> mmhmm
<BR>&lt;JamesBONG> does anybody here use macs?
<BR>&lt;unknown> what?
<BR>&lt;h4x0r3d> lol
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> hehe no
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> $ jobs
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> maybe might list it
<BR>&lt;Dustin> yeah
<BR>*** rs has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> or another prog that lists tasks
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> LKMs aren't listed as jobs right?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> top
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ps
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> just processes maybe?
<BR>*** Norton has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;unknown> top and ps wont list it
<BR>&lt;Dustin> why not
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> what can list them then
<BR>&lt;snider> because its not a userspace program
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> third party program?
<BR>&lt;snider> lsmod lists the loaded kernel modules
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ahh
<BR>&lt;Dustin> wait, are we talking about a lkm sniffer or a 'real' sniffer
<BR>&lt;unknown> Because we will make the kernel do it
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ok
<BR>&lt;unknown> i will get to that later
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> ok ok i think i'm gettin' this
<BR>&lt;unknown> a real sniffer
<BR>&lt;Dustin> so to disguise from lsmod you would put the lkm sniffer
piggybacked with getdents or something
<BR>&lt;unknown> What i will do is to replace getdents and query_module
system calls
<BR>*** suspect has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> so they will remove the what we want from the list
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> you do need root access first to do all this right?
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ok
<BR>&lt;snider> yeah, but then after you can hide files from the *right*
root of the box
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> yup
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ok
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> heehee
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> deviousness!
<BR>&lt;unknown> You can also spread it as a virus
<BR>&lt;unknown> but will get to that
<BR>*** snider sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> SO lets continue
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> wait can you write a worm to do this for u?
<BR>*** Guy_SJS has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: +o Guy_SJS
<BR>&lt;unknown> you can intercept DCC or FTP sessions
<BR>&lt;unknown> and add code for executalbes
<BR>&lt;unknown> so it will be loaded when the file executed by root
<BR>*** SpiderMan has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>*** DElTa_SquaD has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** SpiderMan has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: +o SpiderMan
<BR>&lt;unknown> u can c how to hide files on line 172 in _h_lkm.c
<BR>*** dataholic has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: +v dataholic
<BR>&lt;unknown> Some of the code there is used to hide processes i will
explain it later
<BR>&lt;unknown> I also replaced chdir system call so in order
<BR>&lt;unknown> to execute or read files from hidden folders
<BR>&lt;unknown> you must give full path.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Try to read it if you got questions ask
<BR>&lt;unknown> I commented most of the code so it will be easy to understand
<BR>&lt;unknown> questions?
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> i gotta go
<BR>&lt;mezzano> none yet...the code is pretty easy to read &lt;IMHO>
<BR>&lt;Phr3k> someone send me log later
<BR>*** Phr3k has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK so lets continue

<BR>* dataholic puts on a nice mp3
<BR>&lt;dataholic> ok go with tha flow!
<BR>&lt;dataholic> :)
<BR>&lt;unknown> As you know /proc contains a folder named with
<BR>&lt;unknown> the process id for each process.
<BR>&lt;unknown> To list process with 'ps' for example
<BR>&lt;unknown> ps goes through the /proc dir.
<BR>&lt;unknown> So If we want to hide a process
<BR>&lt;unknown> we check if a process goes through /proc
<BR>&lt;unknown> folder so we need to look for the pid of the process we
want to hide
<BR>&lt;unknown> and remove from the list getdents returns.
<BR>&lt;unknown> :)
<BR>* Guy_SJS bums a cig off dataholic
<BR>&lt;dataholic> lol
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> heh
<BR>&lt;unknown> the /proc&nbsp; folder contains PID's
<BR>&lt;unknown> To do it we need to get the inode in which getdents
<BR>&lt;unknown> is suppose to scan and if its /proc recover the task name
of
<BR>&lt;unknown> each pid and if it starts with _h_ remove it from the
list.
<BR>&lt;unknown> To get the inode we will use the 'current' pointer
<BR>&lt;unknown> which points to data of the current process (that issused
the call)
<BR>&lt;unknown> and its definition is 'struct task_struct *current'(to
see
<BR>&lt;unknown> struct task_struct look in linux/sched.h).
<BR>&lt;unknown> PROC_ROOT_INO is the inode of /proc and its defined in
linux/proc_fs.h.
<BR>&lt;unknown> The MAJOR and MINOR macros are used to check if it the
right device
<BR>&lt;unknown> I will explain more about major and minor numbers in
<BR>&lt;unknown> the 'coding LKM devices' lecture.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Go through the source if you got questions ask.

<BR>&lt;dataholic> to dev/null with you!
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK lets continue
<BR>&lt;Guy_SJS> lol
<BR>*** mezzano has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> so we have hidden our files,folders and processes
<BR>&lt;unknown> but the admin can still see our lkm using lsmod
<BR>&lt;unknown> and remove it. There are several methods to
<BR>&lt;unknown> hide our modules.
<BR>&lt;unknown> One of them (suggested in Phrack 52) is
<BR>&lt;unknown> to manipulate struct module and set the size,refs and
<BR>&lt;unknown> the name of the module to 0. But when i tried it
<BR>&lt;unknown> it didnt work(I think it works only with old kernel,
<BR>&lt;unknown> other wise the kernel is loaded but when you lsmod
<BR>&lt;unknown> some errors occur).
<BR>&lt;unknown> Another way is to intercept sys_query_module system call
<BR>&lt;unknown> you can strace lsmod to see it.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Its easy to implement(almost like getdents).
<BR>&lt;unknown> Look at it in line 321 in _h_lkm.c.
<BR>&lt;unknown> To make it unremovable look intercept int delete_module(char
*name)
<BR>&lt;unknown> and if name is the matches the LKM name return -ENOENT
<BR>&lt;unknown> which means the module is not loaded.
<BR>&lt;unknown> Questions?
<BR>&lt;snider> brilliant
<BR>*** snider sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;Dustin> devious little schemer you
<BR>&lt;unknown> No questions? so lets continue
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> RAWR
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> i'm hungry :(
<BR>&lt;freakOVER> but linux is sexier :\
<BR>&lt;dataholic> lol
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> Another cool idea from phrack is redirection of execve
<BR>&lt;unknown> for example let say you what that every
<BR>&lt;unknown> time login is executed it will execute you login instead
<BR>&lt;unknown> so what you is replacing execve and each time login is
<BR>&lt;unknown> called you call /hiddenpath/my_login.
<BR>&lt;unknown> But ididnt implement it in this module
<BR>&lt;unknown> A few notes about execve.
<BR>&lt;unknown> To replace execve you must put it in some other
<BR>&lt;unknown> place in the sys_call_table(I put it in the end
<BR>&lt;unknown> but you can loop and look for the first NULL)
<BR>&lt;unknown> and modify the registers before calling it
<BR>&lt;unknown> since it expects the data in specific registers.
<BR>&lt;unknown> I wrote an asm code to do it in my LKM.
<BR>&lt;unknown> If anyone knows a better way to do it please
<BR>&lt;unknown> share.
<BR>&lt;unknown> I dont recall which line
<BR>&lt;unknown> look for it
<BR>&lt;snider> 260
<BR>&lt;unknown> What it does is wait till sh is executed and if the last
<BR>&lt;unknown> argument is ___h___ then it gives you root
<BR>&lt;unknown> Someother ideas could be preventing SYS_write from
<BR>&lt;unknown> writing certain IPs, make your file
<BR>&lt;unknown> totaly unaccessable by replacing open system calls
<BR>&lt;unknown> unless you have magic uid, record every thing
<BR>&lt;unknown> the admin does and many other things be creative!!!
<BR>&lt;unknown> TTY hijacking is a cool thing to do.
<BR>&lt;unknown> (I will show how to it in my next lecture)
<BR>&lt;unknown> Questions?
<BR>*** snider sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;jacs> l
<BR>&lt;snider> i guess not
<BR>*** stenas has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> another important system call is socket(int call,unsigned
long *args)).
<BR>&lt;unknown> I didnt implemented it due to a lack of time but i will
<BR>&lt;unknown> explain how it works.
<BR>&lt;unknown> The socket system call handles all the socket operations
<BR>&lt;unknown> (recv,send,connect etc.). Its call argument is the type
<BR>&lt;unknown> of action.
<BR>&lt;unknown> One thing you can do with it is to intercept
<BR>&lt;unknown> RECVFROM call and wait for a packet with
<BR>&lt;unknown> magic size and magic content and then
<BR>&lt;unknown> open a shell on some port to get root.
<BR>&lt;unknown> This idea is implemented by plaguez in Phrack 52.
<BR>&lt;unknown> But this kind of backdoor will not work
<BR>&lt;unknown> if there a firewall on the system.
<BR>&lt;Dustin> unless oyu have physical access
<BR>*** royanee has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;unknown> Sure
<BR>&lt;unknown> but you can overcome this
<BR>*** stenas is now known as royanee
<BR>&lt;unknown> For example you can look for packet that contain
<BR>&lt;unknown> some string lets say &lt;123Order321>
<BR>&lt;unknown> and remove it from the stream
<BR>*** insulted has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> This method
<BR>&lt;insulted> hi
<BR>&lt;unknown> can work without open connection
<BR>&lt;Dustin> ./mode #bsrf +m
<BR>&lt;unknown> because it will be removed from the stream anyway
<BR>*** wascy is now known as wascy|at|work|even|s
<BR>&lt;}{exadecimal> gtg, send me a log
<BR>&lt;unknown> you can hide the ip of these packets by replacing the
write system call
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> log will be on the bsrf site

<BR>&lt;snider> i have a kernel too old to load that helloworld module..
how can the system see that its been written for a newer kernel version
(even when it's as simple as helloworld.c)?
<BR>&lt;snider> thats my only question
<BR>&lt;Dustin> it uses a call not implemented in older kernels?
<BR>*** CoolMoDee has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> What is the messages?
<BR>&lt;unknown> What is the message?
<BR>&lt;snider> that the module was compiled for.. oh wait.. i replaced
my kernel src with the 2.4.7 one a while back
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> unknown would this work for bsd boxes?
<BR>&lt;snider> hehe.. nevermind
<BR>*** Saito has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;unknown> OK so you understood every thing?
