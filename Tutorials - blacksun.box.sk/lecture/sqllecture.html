<P>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay we got something set
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> its going to be an sql lecture
<BR>-xenitanus- thanks :)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> pl/sql then php/sql then cracking sql
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> then we can kill reptile after we are done
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: -m
<BR>&lt;_ciR_> lol
<BR>&lt;MASTURB4TION> sounds ok
<BR>&lt;N0_Nick> hm
<BR>&lt;N0_Nick> okay
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> lol nick, now its 4.30?&nbsp;&nbsp; and before 10.00?=))))))))))))

<BR>&lt;N0_Nick> we will survive
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> =)
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> ok mikkee
<BR>&lt;MASTURB4TION> espescially the end
<BR>&lt;_ciR_> im 4 killing reptile
<BR>&lt;N0_Nick> n0 man
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> d4JinX: is starting
<BR>*** AZTEK sets mode: +m
<BR>&lt;d4JinX> lol
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> take it away d4JinX
<BR>&lt;d4JinX> Am I?
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +o d4JinX
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: -o d4JinX
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> well you want to start with history
<BR>&lt;d4JinX> I think sql should run first..
<BR>*** SySt3mShk has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> ----------------sql lecture------------------------
<BR>&lt;d4JinX> Okay, SQL stands for Structured query language
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> SQL originated from IBM's research labs in the early 1070's
<BR>&lt;d4JinX> k..
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> SQL is the post cursor to SEQUEL
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> Structured English QUEry Language
<BR>*** d4JinX is now known as d4J1nX
<BR>*** Lone[Star] has quit IRC (Quit: see ya pplz l8r)
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> sql is strictly a language to access relational databases
<BR>*** _ciR_ has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> such as oracle or paradox
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> the latest ansi is recomendation sql-92
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> and thats my history now for d4J1nX
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> brb
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> As Aztek said SQL is a language used to access databases
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> It has very simple syntax
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> And is very easy to pick up
<BR>*** SySt3mShk has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 181 seconds)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Languages such as ASP and PHP use SQL statements
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Say we had a database called people
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> I hope everyone knows what a database is ;-)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Within that database would be a number of tables
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> These tables hold the data in the form of fields with their
corresponding types
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok back
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> eg people table
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> This could be made up of
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> wb Az
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> thx
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SURNAME VARCHAR2(50)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> FORENAME VARCHAR2(50)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> TELEPHONE NUMBER
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> VARCHAR and number are the types
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> PHONENUM INTEGER(7)
<BR>*** StartX has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> There would also be an ID field
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Used for indexing and joining tables
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> It has to be unique
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> And it cant be null when a new record is added to the table
<BR>*** SySt3mShk has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> PEOPLE_ID NUMBER
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> So we have a table called people with the fields already
stated
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Say we have a web front end
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> And we want to display all the people within the table
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> We would use a statement like
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> SELECT * FROM People
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SELECT * from people
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> * being all the fields
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> We could pull back one field or two
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SELECT surname,forename FROM table
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> If its a big table
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SELECT *
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Can take a long time
<BR>*** WishGenie has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> So sometimes its better to pull back only the fields required
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> If your lazy as well, SELECT * lol
<BR>*** Drager has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Once we issue this statement a temporary table is setup
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> a view
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Which has the relevant fields and the relevant values
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Yes, you can have views too
<BR>*** CodE4 has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> i was just wondering when you were goign to start them
<BR>*** idiocy|idle has quit IRC (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by
peer))
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> If we want to add to the people tablAka's: Brian-17-, Mr_Innocent
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Name: Brian
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Age: 17
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Department: Warez
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Rank: Head
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Skillz: nuking, kloning, email bombing, spoofing, flooding,
viral attacks, networking, troubleshooting, finding illegal software
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> WeFuck
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> My buffer
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> its what i would have done first
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> kay
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> You go for it
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> lol from that site form the message board
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> phone
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Yep
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> no no your doing fine
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> 2 secs phone
<BR>*** [PhaLanX] has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>*** ken has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** CodE4 has left #bsrf
<BR>*** d4J1nX has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay the lecture will presume in a few min
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> i am sorta not here and here
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> so i will be in and out
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> same here iam going to wrap some stuff for the cracking
part

<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> wb
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Thx
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Side lecture - See when ya have a cable modem, dont let
your cellphone anywhere near it, especially when it rings
<BR>*** AirriK is now known as _AirriK-
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> lol
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Keep getting caught with that
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Had to reboot
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> So, where were we?
<BR>&lt;bluehaze> was there any lecture?
<BR>*** _AirriK- has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> yah were doing an sql lecture instead
<BR>&lt;bluehaze> oh
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> &lt;d4J1nX> If we want to add to the people tablAka's:
Brian-17-, Mr_Innocent
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> &lt;d4J1nX> Name: Brian
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> &lt;d4J1nX> Age: 17

<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> we were up to there
<BR>&lt;bluehaze> who's giving it?
<BR>&lt;bluehaze> oh ok
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> aztek/d4j1nx/and I
<BR>*** lostmode has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Kay
<BR>*** xenitanus has quit IRC (Quit:)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> So basically we pull back a temporary table from that statement
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> We can also have conditional syntax
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Such as
<BR>*** freespeachlamer has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SELECT surname FROM people WHERE surname LIKE '%on'
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Will pull back all the records where the surname has on
at the end
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Or
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SELECT phone_number FROM people WHERE phone_number>809090
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Self explanatry I hope
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> If we want to add to a table
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Then we use an INSERT statement
<BR>*** Litte has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** cupelmen has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> INSERT into people(surname,forname,phone_number) VALUES
('woods','jim',0202020)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> The ID will be created automatically by means of a trigger
- will get to it later
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> If we wanted to update the table then we would use the
UPDATE statement..
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> UPDATE people SET surname='newsurname';
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> deleting would require knowing the id, more practical,
although not necessary
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> DELETE from people where people_id=349
<BR>*** StartX has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> The three basic db maintenance statements
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> All pretty simple syntax, as I mentioned before
<BR>*** Devil_Panther has joined #BSRF
<BR>*** zwanderer has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** Shadow_Stalker has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> So we know how to add to a table in a database, delete
from a table and update a record in a table
<BR>*** reptile has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** Litte has quit IRC (Quit: Clone for reptile w00t w00t)
<BR>*** _ciR_ has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yep it is simple
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> As I mentioned earlier..
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> A trigger is used to created the id automatically
<BR>*** _ciR_ is now known as __ciR_-
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> A trigger is a small script, if you like that will add
the id to the id field on an insert into the table
<BR>*** D12_BoyZ has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> This ID number is taken from a number sequence in the database
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> The sequences are created manually
<BR>*** ewren has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** D12_BoyZ has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Each table that is normalized and has an ID field will
have a different sequence
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Now..
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Say we have another field in our people table
<BR>*** paranoid has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Called contact_name
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> And contact_address
<BR>*** MrBS480 has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** cupelmen has joined #bsrF
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Now in order to normalise a db we would remove these two
"repeating" fields and replace them with one
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Contact_ID
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> And a separate table would be created called contacts
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> This table would have the fields.
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Contact_id
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Contact_name
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +v Devil_Panther
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Contact_address
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> brb door
<BR>*** paranoid has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay seems like reptile showed up, so were going to finish
this lecture and then do the vb coding
<BR>*** MrBS480 has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>*** ewren has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>*** flipu has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> back
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Kay, I hope this is making some sense here, didnt really
have time to prepare
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Right so we now have two tables
<BR>*** lostmode has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Contact table
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> And people table
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Say we wanted all contact names for all the people whose
first name was john
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> We would have to join our tables in the query statement
<BR>*** flipu has quit IRC (Not enough time connected)
<BR>*** torpor has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** __ciR_- has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SELECT contact_name FROM people p,contact c WHERE p.contact_id=c.contact_id
AND forename = 'John'
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Notice the c and p used for an alias and to remove ambiguity
<BR>*** WishGenie has quit IRC (Quit: i gotta reboot)
<BR>*** cupelmen has quit IRC (Quit: time to sleep...)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> That statement will pull back the contact names for all
the people called John
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> On an off note..
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Say we had a drop down/combo box on our webpage
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> And we wanted the full details of a particular person
<BR>*** makzee has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>*** SpiderMan has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** ChanServ sets mode: +o SpiderMan
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> In the drop box we would have the details "John Woods"
or "Chris Simms"
<BR>*** bluehaze has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> But the actual value would be the corresponding id in the
table
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> hail spider
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> hey
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> Spidey
<BR>*** ken has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> all hail SpiderMan
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> hey AZTEK
<BR>*** Capt_InsaneO has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Depending on the langauge being used we loop through each
record brought back from the query and have a formselectOption for each
<BR>*** Mezzano has quit IRC (Read error: 113 (No route to host))
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> SELECT people_id, forename FROM people;
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> The forename would be in the dropdown
<BR>*** torpor has left #bsrf
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> But behind the scenes the actual value for that selection
is the id
<BR>*** Capt_InsaneO has left #bsrf
<BR>*** mezzano has joined #bsrf
<BR>*** acid519 has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Devil_Panther> oh... hi spidy
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> This is moving on to front end languages though and since
php seems to be very popular at the moment, Aztek will take it form here
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Hey Spider :-)
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> hi
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> sorry to disturb
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> np
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok i guess its php time
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> and we are going to php and not perl
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> so soon?
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> lets hit it spidy\
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> nothing more of SQL?
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> WHERE clause
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> php now
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> db normilization
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> ok
<BR>&lt;Devil_Panther> AZTEK,,, i guess you preffer php on perl... huh?!
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> we did the WHERE
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Thats already been done Spider
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> ok
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Plus normalisation - although not alot
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> ok then I guess it is php time :)
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> mysql is the prefered datbase engine of choice by us phpers
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> because it's small, fast, and cheap
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> what make us choose mysql over any other
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> You want me to go into normalisation more first Aztek?
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> exactly
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> cant beat free
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> also it's avaliable on many platforms
<BR>&lt;Devil_Panther> ok ok...
<BR>&lt;Devil_Panther> LECTURE PLS
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea any platform apache and php run mysql does
<BR>&lt;Devil_Panther> lol
<BR>*** BaGeL has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> mysql_connect();
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> you have to connect to the mysql host
<BR>&lt;d4J1nX> Can php use access databases Az?
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> usually localhost
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> d4J1nX: yes
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> actually i am waiting for spidy to give me the syntax since
i don't have my manual open
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> for mysql_connect()?
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> it's localhost, username, password
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> in strings
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea but port
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> and stuff
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> if no port is given it uses the default
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> int mysql_connect ([string hostname [:port] [:/path/to/socket]
[, string username [, string password]]])
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> you don't have to provide the port unless it's different
then the standard
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> i was wanting the full atribs :)
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> ah, I'll open my docs
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok mysql_connect() returns a database handle
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> that we will use later for other things
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> you should always check for a valid handle
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> we use mysql_query();
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> te send a query which d4J1nX when over the standard querys
earlier
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> $con= mysql_connect("localhost", "jared", "pass"); if(!$con)
{die("can't connect!");}
<BR>*** Shiva_Shanti has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> mysql_query("SELECT * FROM people");
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> int mysql_query (string query [, int link_identifier])
<BR>*** d4J1nX has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM people");
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> thats will return what mysql said for the query
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> then you can use functions such as mysql_fetch_array()
to get the results
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> umm thats the reson php is popular for database use its
really easy :)
<BR>*** acid519 has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> use mysql_drop_db("database name"); to delete a database
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> use mysql_create_db("database name"); to create a databse
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> anything else spidy
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> like i said its easy
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> int mysql_create_db (string database name [, int link_identifier])
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> let's give an example
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> from the start
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> how about something to pull news out of a db
<BR>*** d4J1nX has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> let's say a database is set up with an id field and
a news field
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> to get the news out we could do this
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> if (!mysql_connect("host", "user", "pass")) {die("error!");}

<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> that's what the db table would look like
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> $result= mysql_query("SELECT * FROM news ORDER BY id

<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> we use that to select the news and id out
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> then using a while loop fetch all the data

scripts
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> never mind
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> heh nope
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> just wrote it up right now
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> ok

<BR>&lt;_ciR_> lol
<BR>&lt;divinator> yo
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> now i guess Mikkkeee will cover hacking sql
<BR>&lt;BaGeL> sup div
<BR>&lt;_ciR_> he didnt show up
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> yes i have one, but this one doent concern this subject,
so can i ask it?
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> you guys are done?
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> yea
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;()
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> UnHaFox: uh...depends on what it is
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> can i ask?
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> well d4jinx isn't here for perl :(
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> well reptile said he was late but shit lets do my section
and then do one or two of his lectures
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> its not a stupid one
<BR>&lt;reptile> juz ask UnHaFox
<BR>&lt;pixel_chomp> did anyone log this ?
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> i got the log
<BR>&lt;freakOVER[away]> i did
<BR>&lt;freakOVER[away]> i got the logs
<BR>&lt;freakOVER[away]> i'll send'em to u
<BR>&lt;freakOVER[away]> :P
<BR>&lt;_ciR_> k
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> this will be one huge ass log
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay i'll cut up the log
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> and i will probably end up converting it
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> shit 3 lectures
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> lol
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> hahah
<BR>&lt;freakOVER[away]> yea
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> there is so much more to cover
<BR>&lt;freakOVER[away]> we'll have to divide it
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> i'll spend the weekend doing that

<BR>&lt;AZTEK> we barely scratched the surface
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> ask quickly
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> ok, how can i change the version reply of mirc? successfully
changed one of the version replies, but not the first one..... (where it
say micr 5.81) or soemthing like that?
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> thx
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> heh with my I just hex it
<BR>&lt;reptile> UnHaFox:wait for the mirc scriptin lecture
<BR>&lt;reptile> :)
<BR>&lt;mezzano> off topic! ;)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> what version reply? read the irc war tutorial
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> ok
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> sorry
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> i covered that section
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay let me do my section then reptile can do his lecture
<BR>&lt;reptile> *maybe* ill cover hexing the mirc client
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> which are you doing reptile?
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> heh
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> heh
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> guys for more info on php+sql go to www.php.net
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> and look at their docs
<BR>&lt;UnHaFox> ok only use a hex editor, and find this entry, ok thx
guys
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> lol
<BR>&lt;reptile> Mikkkeee:vb,vb advanced,vb super advanced,api and shit,mirc
scriptin,*maybe* haxoring the mirc ckuebt
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> UnHaFox: for an example version me
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay lets do the cracking sql section

<BR>&lt;reptile> *client
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +m
<BR>*** Mikkkeee sets mode: +v reptile
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> okay iam going to talk a bit about breaking into ms sql
servers for versions 6.5 and 7.0
<BR>&lt;reptile> tankies
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> via tcp/ip on port 1433.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> many ms sql servers run on port 1433,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee>&nbsp; if they are not configured to run on another tcp
port. Many scanners can
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> tell you the running sevice on the open port
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> and what service is running
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> ie- Retina from eEye and whatever you use.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> so now
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> lets begin with the brute force attack
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> - many or most databases have some default and well known
passwords.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee>&nbsp; usually the system admin accounts can not be changed
in many of the commercial databases,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> so thats a good thing for us. "sys" for ORACLE and "sa"
for SQL server cannot be changed.
<BR>*** Azido has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> There is no password lockout that is avaiable for sql
server.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> one fault that is quite amusing is that sql sever doesn't
not require a strong password.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> While we know this for a fact its is very trivial and
at the same time eazy to use&nbsp; brute force attacks against the database
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> server with nothing standing in our way that can prevent
us from trying to break it to the highest lvl.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> -okay let me name one good brute forcer.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> goto packetstorm and search for sqlbf
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> if there are any better ones then try those.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> Lets say you have cracked into the database, well once
your in the game begins.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> lets start with system compromise by using extended procedure,
for v6.5
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> Many systems have very powerful feature
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> s
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> convieniet to DATABASES
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> but are going to be our backdoors into the database server
host.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> =usually many databases because of lazy admins have no
password,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> this case the "sa" account, usually the admin is a lazy
bum and has not put a password.
<BR>*** pixel_chomp has quit IRC (Quit: type /quit newbie status to become
an op)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> -so now anyway once we get the password our aim moves
to takeing over the os, which usually is an nt box.
<BR>&lt;AZTEK> hi-ho hi-ho its off to code i go
<BR>*** AZTEK is now known as AZTEK[coding]
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> hehe
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> -by logging in as "sa" the attacker has the use of the
extended stored procedure which is "xp_cmdshell",
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> this will allows an sql server user or attacker to run
an dos cammand as if he is that person running the cammand at the console.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> one thing the attacker can do
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> is add a&nbsp; user into windows nt account
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> and then can do it to the admin group.
<BR>*** Artist has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> to do this
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> they would type
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> :
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> Xp_cmdshell'net user hacker 678re0 /ADD'
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> now the attacker
<BR>*** Shadow_Stalker has quit IRC (Quit: May the force be with you :-))
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> just added a user hacker with the password 678re0
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> hehe nice password.
<BR>&lt;reptile> how cool
<BR>&lt;reptile> wouldnt this be cracking?
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> now lets add it to the administrators group.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> there in
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> already they are backdooring the box
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> they would type:
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> Xp_cmdshell 'net localgroup /ADD Administrators hacker;
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> haha now hacker has become an NT administrator,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> the reason this has worked is because the commnads are
being sumbitted to the os using the nt account under which the sql server
is being run,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> this is local system account
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> which is the most powerful local account on the nt box.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> -Another very good attack is to compromise the nt box
by reading the sam._ file
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> under the winnt/repair/sam._&nbsp; and
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> cracking the hashed password using the cracking tool
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> l0phtCrack
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> that tool is a work of art
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> Lets do this then,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> we will need to use the exteded stored procedurer,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> xp_regread which is from the registry.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> so what are we waiting for lets get that little sam file.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> xp_regread'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE;,'SECURITY\SAM\DOMAINS\ACCOUNT'.'F
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> we were going to read the passord out of the registry
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> so now if your a lazy attacker
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> you might want to use a canned tool, ahh let me name
a good one, goto
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> packetstrom and d/l SQLPOKE.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> now lets talk about other procedures
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> -attacking the database/ gaining the password local compromise.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> well the sa password is stored in clear text
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> so if you got local access goto
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MICROSHIT\ oops
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> lol
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\MSSQLServe\SQLEW\REGISTERED
SERVER\SQL 6.5
<BR>&lt;reptile> mikkkeee is there a way to determine if a server is runnin
SQL?
<BR>*** elite has quit IRC (Quit: )
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> above i talked about the scanner from&nbsp; eEye
<BR>&lt;reptile> retina?
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> yup
<BR>&lt;reptile> that costs $30k dude
<BR>*** Lone[Star] has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;(
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> haha pay
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> lol
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> the VER might be different well thats the path and the
password is stored as clear txt so you shouldn't have a hard time to obtain
it.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> - another attack if the system is not secured usually
its not.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> one method is to scan the host for smb ports (tcp 139,
udp, 137 and 138)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> nt uses them for smb ports to communicate.
<BR>&lt;reptile> tankies
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> these should be closed by a firewall but you can belucky.
<BR>&lt;reptile> im off to writing a simple scanner for this
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> to attack the nt box using this attack you can chk out
rhino9
<BR>&lt;reptile> ;)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> tutorial called "THE WINDOWS NT WARDOC, A STUDY IN REMOTE
PENETRATION"/
<BR>*** d3molisher has joined #bsrf
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> i belive we got an nt tutorial at the tuts page in blacksun
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> -well now you know that both usernames/passwords and
<BR>&lt;reptile> Another good hole in very bad nt machines is the front
page vti thing
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> data is usually sent unencrypted so that means you guessed
it can be sniffeed.
<BR>*** Devil_Panther has quit IRC (Quit: LOL = Lamers On-Line (&reg;&copy;,

<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> nice /quit msg
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> yah the chances are slim
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> like finding phf vul pages
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> but you never know
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> Another method is keyloggers,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> god blessssss the loggers
<BR>&lt;angel> hi Mikkkeee:)))
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> get a good one from www.keyloggers.com
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> hey angel
<BR>&lt;angel> whats up?
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> the best one against nt is called i think stealth keyloger
its the best&nbsp; well the sharewares ones kick ass. get those.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> usually the shareware ones are called legit loggers so
i don't think AV scanners pick up those
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> but they might
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> .

<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> now let me talk a little about securing and we can goto
the other lecture
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> well one thing you can do to protect your self if your
running a dbs is to \:
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> 1-click the encyption option,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> that isn't done by default so you got to do that in order
to encytp it so that could make snifferes useless,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> 2- make sure your got a good firewall setup this is good
for the smb ports and against the portscanners.
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> 3-multi protocol
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> will let you use random tcp ports by default or you can
use fixed ports to ease firewall rulz.
<BR>*** _acid519- has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> 4-if you can try to use muti protocol and enable encryption
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> if not then try to use ip sockest,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> change the default ports and install some good firewall.
<BR>*** Artist has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
<BR>&lt;SpiderMan> Checkpoint Firewall-1 is a good choice
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> 5-Use a&nbsp; COM component or a webserver,
<BR>&lt;Mikkkeee> as the business obj layer.
