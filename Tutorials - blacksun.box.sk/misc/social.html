<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Before I start 
  this tutorial I would like to say something, This topic is a very talked about 
  topic, and I have tried my best to include all that I can, If you cant think 
  of anything better than to flame me for writing this then please don't bother, 
  if you think you can do better, why dont you write a new tutorial on this and 
  we'll gladly upload it.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Welcome 
  to my tutorial. In this text I will try to explain some of the techniques used 
  while trying to social engineer somebody. This will apply to computer chat, 
  phone conversation, and also just day to day life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">So 
  what is social engineering?<br>
  Basically, social engineering is the art and science of getting somebody to 
  comply with your wishes. It is not a form of mind control, it will not allow 
  you to get people to perform tasks wildly outside their normal behaviour and 
  it is far from foolproof.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">It 
  also involves a lot more than simply quick thinking and a few selective accents. 
  Social engineering can involve a lot of groundwork. Like normal hacking, Social 
  engineering needs prior preparation, and the majority of the work goes into 
  this, rather than the actual attempt it self.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Social 
  engineering concentrates on the weakest link of the computer security chain, 
  humans. It is often said that the only secure computer is an unplugged one, 
  even this comment is untrue. It is possible that you could talk somebody into 
  plugging it in and switching it on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900"><br>
  It is also important to note that the human link in the security chain, is the 
  most important one. There is not one computer system in the world that don't 
  exist with out human interaction, and unlike a normal exploit, this vulnerability 
  is universal, independent of platform, software, network or hardware.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Anybody 
  with access to the system physically or electronically is a possible threat. 
  This means that even people not normally included in a security policy could 
  be involved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">It 
  is impossible to obscure the fact that humans use the system or that they can 
  influence it, because as I stated before, there isn't a computer system in the 
  world that does not use human interaction as a part of it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Almost 
  every human has the skills to attempt social engineering, the only difference 
  is the amount of skill used when making use of these tools.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Some 
  of the tools are going to be explained below here, and we make note that these 
  are not foolproof skills, and that common sense is the most important tool that 
  you will ever have.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">The 
  first &quot;skill&quot; and most obvious is simply a direct request, where the 
  individual is asked to complete your task directly. Although least likely to 
  succeed, this is the easiest and most straightforward method. The individual 
  knows exactly what you want them to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">The 
  second is to create a fake situation, which the individual is simply a part 
  of. With more factors than the individual concerned it is more likely that you 
  will succeed, because you create reasons for compliance other than simply personal 
  ones. This involves far more work for the person making the attempt at persuasion, 
  and most certainly involves gaining extensive knowledge of the 'target'. This 
  also does not mean that the whole social engineering operation needs to be all 
  lies, the best operation will be one where the facts are more truthful than 
  lies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">One 
  of the essential tools used for social engineering is a good memory for gathered 
  facts. This is something that hackers and sys-admins excel in, especially in 
  there own field of expertise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Another 
  thing that you can use against somebody is the notation of conformity. It is 
  possible to make somebody to &quot;conform&quot; with the group, even if they 
  know that the decision is wrong, eg. Have you ever been in an assembly/class 
  and the teacher asks a question, eg. Who here has smoked before? When the majority 
  of the class puts their hand up the odd others that haven't tentivally put their 
  hands up so that they do not get looked down upon by their peers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">That 
  is just an example of the extent that people will go to just so that they don't 
  loose face with the friends/ work companions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Using 
  situations where the person is more likely to go with the flow is a effective 
  way to social engineer them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">However 
  most social engineering attempts are done by lone individuals and so the social 
  pressure and other influencing factors to be constructed by creating a believable 
  situation that the target feels emersed in are less effective.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">If 
  the situation, real or imaginary has certain characteristics then the individual 
  is more likely to comply with your requests. Following this paragraph they are 
  listed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Diffusion 
  of responsibility away from the target individual. This is when the individual 
  believes that they are not solely responsible for their actions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">A 
  chance for imagination. Compliance is more likely to occur if the individual 
  believes that by complying that they are ingratiating themselves with someone 
  who may give them future benefits. Getting on the good side of the boss is surely 
  going to have some benefits hey?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Moral 
  duty. This is where the target complies because they believe that it is there 
  moral duty to. Part of this is guilt. People prefer to avoid guilty feelings 
  and so if there is a chance that they will feel guilty they will if possible 
  avoid this outcome.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">On 
  a personal level there are methods used to make a person more likely to cooperate 
  with you. The aim of persuasion is not to force people to complete your tasks, 
  but enhance their voluntary compliance with your requests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Basically 
  the target is simply being guided down the garden path,:P. The target believes 
  that they have control of the situation, and that they are exercising their 
  power to help you out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">The 
  fact that the benefits that the person will gain from helping you out have been 
  invented is irrelevant. The target believes they are making a reasoned decision 
  to exchange these benefits for a small loss of their time and energy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">CO-OPERATION<br>
  There are several factors, which if present will increase the chances of a target 
  co-operating with a social engineer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">The 
  less conflict the better. Co-operation will be readily gained when the softly-softly 
  approach is used. Pulling rank, annoyance or orders rarely work for effective 
  persuasion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Psychological 
  research has also shown that people are more likely to comply with your wishes 
  if you have dealt with the same person before. Before trying the 'big hit' try 
  requesting smaller and more reasonable requests. This way they will be more 
  compliant to your needs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">When 
  attempting a social engineering hack, the more sensory detail you can provide 
  to the target is better. A person would be more compliant to your needs if they 
  can See and smell you as well as speak to you, it is often difficult to get 
  some one to comply with just a simple phone call. However these days the possibilities 
  are great because of the fact that so many businesses are on the net. Another 
  point I am going to make is that it is often impossible to persuade somebody 
  using ASCII chat or e-mail. Ever tried Social Engineering some one on IRC?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">The 
  main thing I can tell you is don't try Social engineering people with higher 
  authority than the made up person you are using, for instance, don't try to 
  Social engineer the sys admin as we all know he's more competent than you are, 
  Especially on his own network.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Remember 
  before attempting to social engineer somebody, you have to do some info searching 
  on that particular person. I have known people to read over people's shoulder 
  when a person was typing on the phone just to gain knowledge on the targets 
  lifestyle and friends. Another aspect of what people will go to just to find 
  out information on people is to watch as they type in their Credit card and 
  ATM pin numbers. Some even go to the extent as to watch from windows across 
  the road with binoculars to see these numbers being punched.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Ever 
  sat in computer class and called to your teacher to type in some sort of password, 
  which you conveniently watch over his fingers on the keyboard as he punches 
  in this innocent request. This is the sort of ways social engineering can be 
  taken into life, I have often used skills described in this tutorial just to 
  nock down prices on goods at a local market.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">When 
  looking for information on a Target, you want to consider going Dumpster diving, 
  or trashing as it is sometimes called. On these outings remember to take a sturdy 
  pair of shoes, gloves and a torch (preferably with red filter), Bolt cutters 
  may come in handy too! Oh and remember to cover yourself up! In these outings 
  you can often find employee names, phone numbers, account details, amongst the 
  mounds of IT treasures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">One 
  technique to use on a target is to pretend you're an employee of another company 
  doing surveys for a hardware company, if you choose to follow this line of attack, 
  have the questions lined up, and make sure you take time as if you were writing 
  down their reply's.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Any 
  information gained from these phone calls can be used, Information on the companies 
  firewalls, routers or servers could be used for further attack on the companies 
  Website.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">So 
  now you have some of the skills that it takes to become a good social engineer, 
  but remember like I said at the start of this tutorial, the most important tool 
  of common sense out weighs any of the skills in this text.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">Even 
  major companies can be social engineered, an example of this is an AOL employee 
  who was having a Tech support session, during which the hacker mentioned he 
  had a car for sale, at a very good price, and the techie was interested. Of 
  course the hacker sent the techie a pic of car, binded to the jpg was a trojan, 
  which enabled the hacker to get into the internal network.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">So 
  remember anything is possible with the right incentive, you just have to please 
  the person's senses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900"><br>
  Happy Hunting,</font></p>
