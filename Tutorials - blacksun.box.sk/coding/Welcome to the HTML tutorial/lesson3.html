<H2>Lesson 3: Basic Tags and Formatting</H2>

So you're probably thinking "Okay, I knew that stuff.  Teach me something I <u>don't</u> know."  Okay, be patient.  I think this lesson will give you your fill.<p>

HTML is a language that is coded with <i>tags</i>.  They are called tags because they tag parts of a webpage for formatting in a browser.  HTML tags are very easy to spot in web page source.  They are the things shown that start with a < and end with a >.  Most HTML tags have an opening tag (&#60;tag&#62) to start formatting text and a closing tag (&#60;/tag&#62) to end the formatting.   <p>

There are some HTML tags that are absolutely necessary in an HTML page.  Those tags are as follows:<p>

&#60;HTML>' and &#60;/HTML>': Usually put at the top (&#60;HTML>) and bottom (&#60;/HTML&#62) of an HTML page.  This tag tells the browser that this page is an HTML page.<p> 

&#60;HEAD&#62 and &#60;/HEAD&#62: This is where information about the entire page is placed.<p>

&#60;TITLE&#62 and &#60;/TITLE&#62: This tag needs to be put between the &#60;HEAD&#62 and &#60;/HEAD&#62.  This tag gives a name for your page.  The name won't be shown in the the text of the page, but rather in the top of the browser window.<p>

&#60;BODY&#62 and &#60;/BODY&#62: This tag defines the body portion of the page.  Later we will learn how to use the &#60;BODY&#62 tag to add background colors, text colors, and margins.<p>

Now that we know the required tags, I'm going to put my text that I gathered in the <A HREF="lesson2.html">last lesson</A> in the proper web page format.<p>

&#60;HTML&#62;<br>
&#60;HEAD&#62;<br>
&#60;TITLE&#62;Justin's Homepage&#60;/TITLE&#62;<br>
&#60;/HEAD&#62;<p>

Welcome to Justin's Web Page!<p>

But wait 1 second! I typed that, and opened it with my browser, and it does'nt come out like that!  What? Does it come out like this:<p>

Welcome to Justin's Web Page!

Yes? Ohmygod! We forgot the formatting tags!<p>

The &#60;p&#62; tag can add paragraph spacing to your page.  The &#60;BR&#62; tag adds a single line break to your page.<p>

These tags do not need a &#60;p&#62; and &#60;/p&#62;, or &#60;BR&#62; and &#60;/BR&#62;, unlike the other tags.<p>

So now our page is coded like this:<p>

&#60;HTML&#62;<br>
&#60;HEAD&#62;<br>
&#60;TITLE&#62;Justin's Homepage&#60;/TITLE&#62;<br>
&#60;/HEAD&#62;<p>

&#60;BODY&#62;<p>

Welcome to Justin's Web Page!&#60;p&#62;<p>

&#60;/BODY&#62;<BR>
&#60;/HTML&#62;<p>

Great! We have format! Now i'll bet you want that first line to be large, right? This can be accomplished by what's called a "header".  The header is made by putting in &#60;Hx&#62; "header text goes here" &#60;/Hx&#62;, where the "x" is a number from 1-6, the bigger the number the bigger the header.  So in our page it looks like &#60;H2&#62;Welcome to Justin's Web Page!&#60;/H2&#62;.  Note that i removed the &#60;p&#62; tag, since header are already paragraph spaced!<p>

Go ahead and make your page, save it with a ".html" extension at the end (HTML pages all need either .htm or .html extensions) open it with your browser and meet me at the <A HREF="lesson4.html">next lesson!</A><p>
