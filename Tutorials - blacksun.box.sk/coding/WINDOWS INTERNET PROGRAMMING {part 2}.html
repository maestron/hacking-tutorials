<br>1.0<a NAME="1"></a> INTRODUCTION
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the last part in this series of tutorials I discussed windows sockets
programming using
<br>the winsock API and in that document I mentioned that the windows Sockets
implementation is
<br>based on the Berkeley Sockets idea, therefore socket programming on
systems such as UNIX
<br>and Linux, which are also based on the Berkeley API would be quiet
similar. This aids us
<br>in porting from platform to platform, making it easy to move whole
programs from UNIX to
<br>windows in a very short time.
<p>This tutorial will discuss and illustrate the differences in code and
functions between the
<br>platforms and sample source code and applications will be provided
to show how to port the
<br>applications piece by piece.
<p>I suggest that you first read Part 1 in this series of tutorials and
also Bracaman's basic
<br>UNIX sockets tutorial, also available from blacksun.box.sk and also
from code.box.sk.
<p>Any add on information for this tutorial and updates are available as
usual from:
<br>http://www.geocities.com/winnetprogram.
<br>&nbsp;

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="70%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2.0&nbsp;<a NAME="2"></a>UNIX AND WINDOWS
<br>=====================
<p>Unix and Windows handle sockets differently, UNIX treats sockets the
same as a file handle
<br>which is a small integer while in windows it is an unsigned type called
SOCKET.
<p>So from the start UNIX and windows actually think of there respective
sockets differently.
<p>To best explain the differences the following is an exert from bracamans
tutorial and
<br>describes sockets from the Unix point of view:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"In a very simple way, a socket is a way to talk to other computer.
<p>To be more precise, it's a way to talk to other computers using standard
Unix file
<br>descriptors.
<p>In Unix, every I/O actions are done by writing or reading to a file
descriptor. A file
<br>descriptor is just an integer associated with an open file and it can
be a network connection,
<br>a terminal, or something else."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="70%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3.0&nbsp;<a NAME="3"></a>ERROR CODES
<br>=======================================
<p>In UNIX error codes are available trough the errno variable. In windows
we use the function
<br>WSAGetLastError() to obtain these error codes.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>_________________________
<p>4.0&nbsp;<a NAME="4"></a>PORT NUMBERS
<br>=======================================
<p>In both Unix and Windows you define the port numbers by entering the
destination port number
<br>as a parameter to the function htons(), however in winsock.h several
port numbers are defined
<br>for common ports so that you can also use these.
<p>The following is a list of the default names and there relative port
numbers:
<br>
<pre>

1.  IPPORT_ECHO             -  7
2.  IPPORT_DISCARD          -  9
3.  IPPORT_SYSTAT           -  11
4.  IPPORT_DAYTIME          -  13
5.  IPPORT_NETSTAT          -  15
6.  IPPORT_FTP              -  21
7.  IPPORT_TELNET           -  23
8.  IPPORT_SMTP             -  25
9.  IPPORT_TIMESERVER       -  37
10. IPPORT_NAMESERVER       -  42
11. IPPORT_WHOIS            -  43
12. IPPORT_MTP              -  57

<br>&nbsp;
<p>5.0&nbsp;<a NAME="5"></a>INCLUDE FILES
<br>=======================================
<p>In UNIX there are a number of include files to use in socket programming,
following is a
<br>list of these functions and related #include files:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5.1&nbsp;<a NAME="5.1"></a>socket()
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/types.h>&nbsp; ]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/socket.h> ]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5.2&nbsp;<a NAME="5.2"></a>bind()
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/types.h>&nbsp; ]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/socket.h> ]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5.3&nbsp;<a NAME="5.3"></a>connect()
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/types.h>&nbsp; ]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/socket.h> ]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5.4&nbsp;<a NAME="5.4"></a>listen()
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/types.h>&nbsp; ]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/socket.h> ]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5.5&nbsp;<a NAME="5.5"></a>accept()
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ #include &lt;sys/socket.h> ]
<p>5.6&nbsp;<a NAME="5.6"></a>gethostname()
<p>&nbsp; [ #include &lt;netdb.h>&nbsp;&nbsp; ]
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>You will need some general socket include files also in UNIX programming:
<p>#include &lt;netinet/in.h>
<br>#include &lt;arpa/inet.h>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Your average list of include files at the top of a UNIX socket program
would therefore
<br>look something like the following:
<p>#include &lt;sys/types.h>
<br>#include &lt;sys/socket.h>
<br>#include &lt;netdb.h>
<br>#include &lt;netinet/in.h>
<br>#include &lt;arpa/inet.h>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In windows the header file for socket and internet programming is contained
in windows.h,
<br>therefore the top of a windows socket programming would look like this:
<p>#include &lt;windows.h>
<p>The name of the header file for windows socket programming is winsock.h
and including
<br>this file in your project as well wont cause any errors of course but
there’s just no need.
<p>Windows programs also need to be linked to the file Wsock32.lib before
they can be
<br>compiled.
<p>Consult your compilers documents for further information on this or
proceed to Appendix 1
<br>- The compiler.

<br>
<p>6.0<a NAME="6"></a>COMMON FUNCTIONS
<br>=======================================
<p>Both Unix and Windows sockets have a set of functions common to both
platforms. These are
<br>mostly the functions dealing with TCP and UDP and all conversion functions
and structures
<br>are the same for both platforms.
<p>For example htons() and inet_addr() are the same on both platforms,
also so is the
<br>structures sockaddr and sockaddr_in.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here is a list of common functions.
<p>1.&nbsp; Socket()
<p>2.&nbsp; Bind()
<p>3.&nbsp; Listen()
<p>4.&nbsp; Connect()
<p>5.&nbsp; Accept()
<p>6.&nbsp; Send()
<p>7.&nbsp; Recv()
<p>8.&nbsp; Sendto()
<p>9.&nbsp; Recvfrom()
<p>10. Gethostname()
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="70%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p>7.0<a NAME="7"></a> RENAMED FUNCTIONS
<br>=======================================
<p>There are some functions which exist in both windows and UNIX socket
programming but
<br>during the conversion the names have changed slightly.
<p>The following table contains a comparison of renamed functions in windows
and UNIX.<br>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="70%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p>8.0<a NAME="8"></a> BLOCKING ROUTINES
<br>=======================================
<p>In windows you can use blocking routines but they are not recommended.
In windows 3.1
<br>using the event driven paradigm it is possible to have a blocked operation
disturbed
<br>by other event driven activity.
<p>Soon you will not be able to have blocking routines in Winsock applications
so it is
<br>not recommended you use them at all in this scenario as this would
limit distribution
<br>possibilities.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="70%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p>9.0&nbsp;<a NAME="9"></a>ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS
<br>=======================================
<p>In windows there are some functions which aren't seen in UNIX sockets.
In every
<br>windows socket program you must call WSAStarup() before you can call
any socket
<br>functions or use any code.
<p>Additionally every WSAStartup() function has a corresponding WSACleanup()
which
<br>shuts down the Winsock and cleans up after us.
<p>Every Windows socket program must contain both of these functions.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="70%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p>10.0&nbsp;<a NAME="10"></a>PORTING CODE
<br>=======================================
<p>Now that we have discussed the different parts of the program in Unix
and its relevant
<br>Windows parts we can look at some real code.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>[ 10.1 ]<a NAME="10.1"></a> DNS PROGRAM
<p>The first program we come across is Bracamans DNS application. Here’s
the Unix Code.
<p>/* &lt;---- SOURCE CODE STARTS HERE ----> */
<p>#include &lt;stdio.h>
<br>#include &lt;netdb.h>&nbsp;&nbsp; /* This is the header file needed
for gethostbyname() */
<br>#include &lt;sys/types.h>
<br>#include &lt;sys/socket.h>
<br>#include &lt;netinet/in.h>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[])
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; struct hostent *he;
<p>&nbsp; if (argc!=2){
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Usage: %s &lt;hostname>\n",argv[0]);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit(-1);
<br>&nbsp; }
<p>&nbsp; if ((he=gethostbyname(argv[1]))==NULL){
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("gethostbyname() error\n");
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit(-1);
<br>&nbsp; }
<p>&nbsp; printf("Hostname : %s\n",he->h_name);&nbsp; /* prints the hostname
*/
<br>&nbsp; printf("IP Address: %s\n",inet_ntoa(*((struct in_addr *)he->h_addr)));
/* prints IP address */
<br>}
<br>/* &lt;---- SOURCE CODE ENDS HERE ----> */
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is a very small but still a very useful program. If we attempt
to compile this
<br>right away under Microsoft Visual C++ We will get an error saying that
it can not
<br>find an include file, so our first duty is to remove all of the Unix
Socket include
<br>files and replace them with the line:
<p>#include &lt;windows.h>
<p>remembering to leave stdio.h right where it is.
<br>When I tried compiling it now I got several more errors so I changed
the
<br>main() fuction from what it is above to:
<p>void main(int argc, char **argv) and the program then compiled.
<p>However I then got several linker errors. Remember when socket programming
on windows
<br>you must link to the file Wsock32.lib.
<p>After I linked to the proper .lib file the program compiles perfectly,
without the
<br>need to touch a single line of the socket code!!
<p>This is how compatible different platforms can be with socket code,
however this is a
<br>very small program and this is not usually the case. The following
is the windows
<br>source code for the port of Bracamans DNS program.
<p>Remember you will get an error unless you include WSAStartup() and WSACleanup()!!
<br>&nbsp;
<p>/* &lt;---- SOURCE CODE STARTS HERE ----> */

<p>&nbsp; WSAStartup(0x0101,&amp;wsdata);
<p>&nbsp; struct hostent *he;
<p>&nbsp; if (argc! = 2)
<br>&nbsp; {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Usage: %s hostname\n",argv[0]);
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return -1;
<br>&nbsp; }
<p>&nbsp; if ((he = gethostbyname(argv[1])) == NULL)
<br>&nbsp; {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("gethostbyname() error\n");
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return -1;
<br>&nbsp; }
<p>&nbsp; printf("Hostname : %s\n",he->h_name);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/* prints the hostname */
<br>&nbsp; printf("IP Address: %s\n",inet_ntoa(*((struct in_addr *)he->h_addr)));&nbsp;
/* prints IP address */
<p>&nbsp; WSACleanup();
<br>&nbsp; return -1;
<p>}
<br>/* &lt;---- SOURCE CODE ENDS HERE ----> */
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This program has almost as few lines as the UNIX alternative and requires
practically
<br>no porting at all!
<p>Like I said you wouldn’t usually have a program that runs on windows
with such little altering.
<br>Lets discuss porting Bracamans TCP streaming server.

<p>Well lets try and compile shall we...
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Straight away we should clear the obvious problems, link to Winsock32.lib
and
<br>only include windows.h and stdio.h.
<p>Having done so we receive 2 errors, the first pertains to bzero which
we do not
<br>have in our little program so we are going to just remove the line
that contains
<br>it. Once we do so we now have only 1 error, woohoo!
<p>This error tells us that the function close() is not a valid identifier
which is
<br>what I said earlier, close() has been replaced by closesocket() in
windows so we
<br>change that as well to closesocket().
<p>We run this program and we recieve a socket error :(. But remember we
never entered
<br>WSAStartup() and WSACleanup() in this program so we have to do that
first and then
<br>our program will work :).
<p>If you run the program the command prompt should remain blank, just
leave the program
<br>as it is now and move onto the next section to figure out where to
go from here!!
<p>First of course here’s the Windows code for the port ;).

<p>There’s actually no real difference with this port and the last. The
same lines are
<br>changed and the same functions are included as before.
<p>Start the program by switching to its directory on the command line
and typing
<p>streamclient.exe local host
<p>Where streamclient.exe is the name of the stream client program we just
ported
<br>naturally :).
<p>Just make sure that the previous example, the streaming server is running
and
<br>your away. The screen will print the line "Welcome to my server." Congratulations
<br>you’ve ported your first Unix Socket client and server to windows and
you received
<br>a line of text back from your own server :).

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="70%">
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>11.0&nbsp;<a NAME="11"></a>Planning
<br>=======================================
<p>When porting its probably best to go trough things like a check list
before attempting
<br>to compile the bloody thing. Here’s a list of some recommendations
to run trough first.
<p>1. Replace all network header files with windows.h or winsock.h.
<br>2. Make sure to add WSAStartup() and WSACleanup() before and after
the code.
<br>3. Replace functions such as close() and ioctl() with windows counterparts.
<br>4. Take care of problems such as bzero() and add any windows specific
features like
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; default ports.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>With so few and simple operations like this it would be pretty damn
easy to write
<br>a program that performs these actions for you, I doubt it would be
complete but hey
<br>it would save you a lot of time in the long run, especially with larger
applications.

<p>12.0<a NAME="12"></a> LAST WORDS
<br>==============
<p>Well that’s it for this tutorial, or at least this part of it. More
parts are planned so
<br>hopefully you should see them on blacksun soon :). This part covered
the basics of
<br>windows programming, there was no point in writing about UNIX programming
as bracaman
<br>has released a very good tutorial on basic UNIX sockets programming
which is available
<br>from blacksun.box.sk and code.box.sk.
<p>I will be discussing Unix sockets again however in the next part of
this tutorial but
<br>mostly in a porting sense. To see what’s planned for future parts so
far just look down :).
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Part 2. -&nbsp; GENERAL SOCKETS&nbsp; - Porting to windows and cross
platform code.
<br>Part 3.&nbsp; -&nbsp; RAW Sockets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Have more
control over packets with raw sockets.
<br>Part 4.&nbsp; -&nbsp; ADVANCED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A real
world example by building an internet communication suite.
<br>Part 5.&nbsp; -&nbsp; FINISHING OFF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Putting it
all together in one big program.
<p>So that’s what’s still to come, but I may change some of these future
tutorials at any
<br>time before there released if I do so it will be to improve the series
in my view and
<br>remember send me comments and suggestions and your ideas might also
change the layout
<br>of following tutorials.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Well thank you for reading this tutorial and visit my website to keep
up to date with
<br>the series and for add on code and articles to the series.
<p>- BR ;)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>*<a NAME="final"></a>FINAL NOTE*
<p>Id really like to thank Bracaman for everything including allowing me
to use code from
<br>his tutorial and please remember that this tutorial should be read
with his (after his
<br>1 even :P), so thanks for everything Bracaman it helped so much :).

<p>APPENDIX A - THE COMPILER<a NAME="appxA"></a>
<br>
<p>All of the programs in this tutorial have been tested under Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0,
<br>im running Windows 2000 Professional edition and I have an Intel Pentium
2.
<p>To set up the compiler for Winsock programming you need to link Wsock32.lib
to your project.
<br>Under Visual C++ do the following.
<p>1. Select the File view tab.
<br>2. Right Click the files menu and go to Settings.
<br>3. Select the Link tab in Project Settings.
<br>4. Add Wsock32.lib to the list of .lib files and press ok.
<p>The winsock.h header file is included in windows.h so don’t worry about
that.
