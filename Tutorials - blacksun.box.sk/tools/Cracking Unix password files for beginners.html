<hr width="250" align="left">
<p><br>
  I guess you're a newbie in pass-cracking like I was and you've probably started 
  John the Ripper full of enthusiasm, and got.... nothing. So the first thought 
  you have is 'my god this must be hard, and I'm a newbie'. Forget it!!! You're 
  always a newbie, and we all are... in pass cracking world, pardon, pass recovering 
  world (or any world else) you always have something to learn. Sometimes, even 
  if you are experienced in password cracking, you won't be able to crack the 
  password or even get your own password. This is a pure technical manual and 
  will give you only the recipe for cracking, but every password needs different 
  approach...</p>
<p>OK, so a good way to get somewhere is to start getting somewhere...<br>
  What you're about to learn is to crack *nix(Unix/Linux/etc.) password files. 
  It does not mean that you need to have some Unix distribution on your box, but 
  it means you'll have to stop clicking your ass off all around the screen... 
  'What this fool is trying to say', you'll probably ask... This fool is trying 
  to say that john is a DOS program (there is also Linux/Unix version, but I guess 
  that most of the people that read this tutorial have win boxes). I will try 
  to put this tutorial through the examples so it wouldn't look like a boring 
  script with incredible amount of switches. After reading this text it wouldn't 
  be a bad idea to look at the texts you get with John. I learnt it all from there, 
  but that, of course, was the hard way, and you want the easy way, right? Right.</p>
<p>First, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get yourself John the Ripper, I guess... 
  if you don't have it you can find it at:</p>
<p>1) packetstorm.securify.com (look at archives, password cracking)<br>
  2) neworder.box.sk (do some searching by yourself)</p>
<p>John can be found practically anywhere. For example: try going to altavista.com 
  and running a search for 'john the ripper'.</p>
<p>Second thing you'll need is.... a HUUUUGE amount of password dictionaries (I'll 
  explain what these are in a minute). The best dictionary around is at www.theargon.com 
  and packetstorm (look at the archives) and is called theargonlistserver1 and 
  is about 20Mb packed, and over 200Mb<br>
  unpacked... get it!!!! The people at theargon did a terrific job.</p>
<p>You should also get some smaller dictionary files (I'll explain why later).</p>
<font size="4"><b>2) Do we look like *nix?</b></font><br>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p><br>
  So now you have john, loaded with that huuuuge pass dictionary, and you think 
  that you can crack anything... If you plan to live for 100000 years, that wouldn't 
  be a problem, but you only have some 80 years left in the best case scenario 
  (unless, of course, scientists find a way to... oh, nevermind).</p>
<p>Now, the first thing is that you have to make sure your password file really 
  looks like a Unix password file (were talking about the /etc/passwd file).</p>
<p>Let's see how Unix pass files look like</p>
<p> owner:Ejrt3EJUnh5Ms:510:102:Some free text:/home/subdir/owner:/bin/bash</p>
<p>The important part is the username and the encrypted password, which are the 
  first and the second parts (each line is divided into seven parts by : symbols)</p>
<p> owner:Ejrt3EJUnh5Ms</p>
<p>Owner is the username and 'that other thing' is the crypted password (encrypted 
  in altered DES (Data Encryption Standard) encryption). For the other part you 
  can put anything that looks like that but the structure must be same so the 
  john could recognize it as unix pass. In fact the other part</p>
<p> :510:102:Some free text:/home/subdir/owner:/bin/bash</p>
<p>Is just some information about the user, his home directory, etc...</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll have passes that have only the first and second part, such 
  as password files that you got from a webboard running matt's web board script.</p>
<p> owner:Ejrt3EJUnh5Ms</p>
<p>You'll have to put the other part so that password would look like unix pass, 
  and you can do a copy-paste from another pass, you can even use</p>
<p> :510:102:His name:/home/subdir/owner:/bin/bash</p>
<p>What you have now should look like:</p>
<p> owner:Ejrt3EJUnh5Ms:510:102:His name:/home/subdir/owner:/bin/bash</p>
<p>Hell, you can even put</p>
<p> owner:Ejrt3EJUnh5Ms:a:a:a:a:a</p>
<p>It won't matter to john at all.</p>
<font size="4"><b>3) We're getting somewhere... nowhere</b></font><br>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p>Now you're ready to crack. Type in</p>
<p> john -w:words.lst password.file</p>
<p>Where words.lst is password dictionary and password file where you have your 
  password or passwords. If you use it on example i gave to you you'll probably 
  get password because it's really weak pass. You'd be surprised to see that people 
  usually use really weak passes like their names, pet names, or even their username 
  (for example: username=zalabuk, password=zalabuk).</p>
<p> Hint: Don't be stupid! Use strong passes like<br>
  <br>
  p4sswr!@<br>
  p@s$w11s<br>
  with as many characters you can remember. Hint is to use special characters 
  and numbers those passes are much harder to crack (I'll explain why in a minute).<br>
  The other hint is to use passes as long as you can remember, 8 characters are 
  sometimes not enough... it depends what box that someone who cracks has... on 
  dual alpha is certainly not enough... in other words... more than 10 characters 
  will do fine, even more wouldn't hurt (like 16...). By the way, older *nix have 
  fixed pass length of 8 chars... that is old DES crypted pass that uses a 64-bit 
  key... now there are 128-bit keys, and some perverts use even more, so there 
  is more fun now :)<br>
  <br>
  john -w:words.lst password.file</p>
<p>Wait wait wait! What am I doing here?<br>
  Alright, listen up carefully. The DES encryption that Unix uses CANNOT be reversed. 
  Some encryptions can be reversed using a sometimes simple or sometimes incredibly 
  complicated algorithm (in the 3rd century AD, Ceasar used to send encrypted 
  letters which used a formula of &quot;shift by three&quot;, which means that 
  d stands for a, e stands for b etc'. At that time, such an algorithm was just 
  fine. Today, it isn't).<br>
  So anyway, the altered DES encryption that Unix uses for it's password files 
  cannot be reversed. Why? Because it's a key-based encryption. The encryption 
  algorithm uses a bunch of letters (lowercase and uppercase), numbers and symbols 
  within the algorithm. So, in other words, to run the decryption algorithm you 
  will need this key, which you simply cannot just have, because the key is the 
  password! You see, when a user picks a password, the system generates an encrypted 
  password for him, called a hash (which is what you get when you somehow acquire 
  a password file), which is created by running this altered DES algorithm using 
  the user's password as a key. If you try to decrypt the password using standard 
  reversable DES encryption, you get a null string.<br>
  So how do John and other password crackers do it? Easy. They try to recreate 
  this process by taking passwords out of these dictionary files (or wordlists) 
  and using them as keys for this altered DES algorithm process. Then, they compare 
  the result to all the encrypted passwords within the password file you've given 
  them. If the two strings match - there you have it! The password is yours!</p>
<p>If the first step doesn't work, the next step would be to do this:</p>
<p> john -w:words.lst -rules password.file</p>
<p>This switch turn on not only browsing through the dictionary, but it uses some 
  modifications of the words that are word dictionary (like adding a number at 
  the end of pass - fool -&gt; fool1, etc' etc'). This one will take long with 
  huge pass dictionary, but it may give better results... For a start you could 
  do a try with a small pass dictionary, and if it doesn't works you can try it 
  with a huge pass dictionary.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are not stupid when they choose passwords and basic rules 
  won't do a job... aaargh. As you've seen it takes more and more time for your 
  CPU to crack this thing out as we go further. Now you can leave your computer 
  on and go to sleep....</p>
<p>If you want to get even more possible passwords out of your password file, 
  try typing</p>
<p> john -i password.file</p>
<p>This -i stands for incremental cracking, not a really good word for it, but...<br>
  Okay, what the hell does it do? It uses the default incremental mode parameters, 
  which are defined in john.ini.<br>
  What does this mean? Do you remember -rules? Yes, well, of course you do, unless 
  you're either incredibly senile or you've stopped reading after this part and 
  only came back, like... a couple of years later. That is very much like rules, 
  but much much more powerful than -rules, and it takes much, much more time.</p>
<font size="4"><b>4) So where are we now (dictionary vs. brute-force)?</b></font><br>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p><br>
  You can see that in all cases you use so-called dictionary cracking... but hell, 
  why not just run John on a mode where it tried all possible combinations of 
  lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and symbols? I mean, this would be 
  much more efficient, right? ... WROOOOOOONGG!!!<br>
  This method is called 'brute-force' attack (basically, dictionary attack is 
  also sort of brute-force attack, but most people use the word brute-force for 
  this specific attack).<br>
  What are the differences? First and most important, with dictionary you go through 
  the selected words that could be passwords and their modifications, and with 
  brute force cracking you use ALL possible combinations. That means you have<br>
  comb=nrch^let</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p> comb - number of possible combinations<br>
  nrch - number of chars<br>
  let - number of letters used</p>
<p>In case you're dealing with john's default -i 95 character set and, presume, 
  a 6 letter password you have possible 735091890625 combinations! OUCH!!<br>
  Sure, this is useful for passwords like 2405v7, but still... with the computational 
  powers of today's modern PC, I'd just give up, unless I had access to some University's 
  supercomputer, which I'd bet noone would ever give me (well, at least not for 
  free, and certainly not to run a password cracker on it).<br>
  As you can see it can take a looooong time until you crack a single one pass, 
  do a little math and try to calculate how many possible combinations there are 
  for 10, 12 and 16 chars.<br>
  I don't think you'll like the answer :)<br>
  Of course, sometimes dictionary attacks are not enough, but john has very powerful 
  'thinking'. In 'incremental' mode john will do all possible combinations from 
  0 to 8 characters (by zero password length is considered a hashed empty string, 
  this sometimes happens). So incremental mode is one sort of brute-force attack 
  in some way...</p>
<p>If you want to fire all weapons at one then you use</p>
<p> john password.file</p>
<p>this will do first basic dictionary attack, then -rules, then -i</p>
<font size="4"><b>5) What if...</b></font><br>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p>Ok, you have to turn off your box from time to time, don't you? If you're doing 
  that haaard password that will take more than 20 hours of cracking you can set 
  john with ctrl+c and then resume with</p>
<p> john -restore</p>
<p>If your box crashes or if there's a power failure, you won't be able to restore 
  your cracking sessions (sometimes)... well that's just too bad. Hell, it happened<br>
  to me once :-(</p>
<p>John is modular, and that is the most powerful thing about john the ripper, 
  and that is what makes john the most advanced password cracker. John is very, 
  very modular. John uses modes that are described in john.ini (do you still remember 
  that incremental cracking i was talking about? Modes for rules and incremental 
  are described in john.ini).<br>
  If you're some inventive guy then you may change the parameters in john.ini.</p>
<p>Here is example how some default parameters for -i look like:</p>
<p> # Incremental modes<br>
  [Incremental:All]<br>
  File = ~/all.chr<br>
  MinLen = 0<br>
  MaxLen = 8<br>
  CharCount = 95</p>
<p>Ok... what do we have here?</p>
<p> [Incremental:All] - this stands for the beginning of the definition for the 
  -i:all switch<br>
  File - filename of file that has characters used in mode -i:all (whole character<br>
  set)<br>
  MinLen - logically, minimum length of password that john -i:all would try<br>
  MaxLen - even more logical, maximum length of password that will john -i:all 
  try<br>
  CharCount - number of chars used by john when you 'turn on' this switch</p>
<p>So, there are some more switches... heh<br>
  Yes there are and down there are all default modes pasted from john the ripper's 
  documents:</p>
<b><font size="4">John the Ripper's Command Line Options</font></b><br>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p>You can list any number of password files on John's command line, and also<br>
  specify some of the following options (all of them are case sensitive, but<br>
  can be abbreviated; you can also use the GNU-style long options syntax):</p>
<ul>
  <li>single &quot;single crack&quot; mode Enables the &quot;single crack&quot; 
    mode, using rules from [List.Rules:Single].</li>
  <li>wordfile:FILE wordlist mode, read words from FILE,</li>
  <li>stdin or from stdin These are used to enable the wordlist mode.</li>
  <li>rules enable rules for wordlist mode Enables wordlist rules, that are read 
    from [List.Rules:Wordlist].</li>
  <li>incremental[:MODE] incremental mode [using section MODE] Enables the incremental 
    mode, using the specified ~/john.ini definition (section [Incremental:MODE], 
    or [Incremental:All] by default).</li>
  <li>external:MODE external mode or word filter Enables an external mode, using 
    external functions defined in ~/john.ini's [List.External:MODE] section.</li>
  <li>stdout[:LENGTH] no cracking, write words to stdout When used with a cracking 
    mode, except for &quot;single crack&quot;, makes John print the words it generates 
    to stdout instead of cracking. While applying<br>
    wordlist rules, the significant password length is assumed to be LENGTH, or 
    unlimited by default.</li>
  <li>restore[:FILE] restore an interrupted session Continues an interrupted cracking 
    session, reading point information from the specified file (~/restore by default).</li>
  <li>session:FILE set session file name to FILE Allows you to specify another 
    point information file's name to use for this cracking session. This is useful 
    for running multiple instances of John in parallel, or just to be able to 
    recover an older session later, not always continue the latest one.</li>
  <li>status[:FILE] print status of a session [from FILE] Prints status of an 
    interrupted or running session. To get an up to date status information of 
    a detached running session, send that copy of John a SIGHUP before using this 
    option.</li>
  <li>makechars:FILE make a charset, overwriting FILE Generates a charset file, 
    based on character frequencies from ~/john.pot, for use with the incremental 
    mode. The entire ~/john.pot will be used for<br>
    the charset file unless you specify some password files. You can also use 
    an external filter() routine with this option.</li>
  <li>show show cracked passwords Shows the cracked passwords in a convenient 
    form. You should also specify the password files. You can use this option 
    while another John is cracking, to see what it did so far.</li>
  <li>test perform a benchmark Benchmarks all the enabled ciphertext format crackers, 
    and tests them for<br>
    correct operation at the same time.</li>
  <li>users:[-]LOGIN|UID[,..] load this (these) user(s) only Allows you to filter 
    a few accounts for cracking, etc. A dash before the list can be used to invert 
    the check (that is, load all the users that aren't listed).</li>
  <li>groups:[-]GID[,..] load this (these) group(s) only Tells John to load users 
    of the specified group(s) only.</li>
  <li>shells:[-]SHELL[,..] load this (these) shell(s) only This option is useful 
    to load accounts with a valid shell only, or not to load accounts with a bad 
    shell. You can omit the path before a shell name, so '-shells:csh' will match 
    both '/bin/csh' and '/usr/bin/csh', while '-shells:/bin/csh' will only match 
    '/bin/csh'.</li>
  <li>salts:[-]COUNT set a passwords per salt limit This feature sometimes allows 
    to achieve better performance. For example you can crack only some salts using 
    '-salts:2' faster, and then crack the<br>
    rest using '-salts:-2'. Total cracking time will be about the same, but you 
    will get some passwords cracked earlier.</li>
  <li>format:NAME force ciphertext format NAME<br>
    Allows you to override the ciphertext format detection. Currently, valid<br>
    format names are DES, BSDI, MD5, BF, AFS, LM. You can use this option when<br>
    cracking or with '-test'. Note that John can't crack password files with<br>
    different ciphertext formats at the same time.</li>
  <li>savemem:LEVEL enable memory saving, at LEVEL 1..3<br>
    You might need this option if you don't have enough memory, or don't want<br>
    John to affect other processes too much. Level 1 tells John not to waste<br>
    memory on login names, so you won't see them while cracking. Higher levels<br>
    have a performance impact: you should probably avoid using them unless John<br>
    doesn't work or gets into swap otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<font size="4"><b>6) Tips</b></font><br>
<hr width="250" align="left">
<p>I) A good schedule to do your cracking job is</p>
<p> john -w:words.lst password.file<br>
  <br>
  john -w:words.lst -rules password.file<br>
  <br>
  john -w:words.lst password.file<br>
  <br>
  john -i:digits password.file<br>
  <br>
  john -i:all password.file</p>
<p>II) If you have a file that has only passes that look like</p>
<p> owner:*:510:102:His name:/home/subdir/owner:/bin/bash<br>
  <br>
  you have a shadowed passwords file.<br>
  Go to the Byte-Me page at blacksun.box.sk and try to find out more about<br>
  password files (I'll leave it up to you to do this. It's important that you'll<br>
  learn how to find things by yourself).</p>
<p>III) You have some little tools that you get with john, they are all<br>
  listed below (from john's docs)</p>
<p><br>
  unshadow PASSWORD-FILE SHADOW-FILE<br>
  Combines the passwd and shadow files (when you already have access to<br>
  both) for use with John. You might need this since if you only used your<br>
  shadow file, the GECOS information wouldn't be used by the &quot;single crack&quot;<br>
  mode, and also you wouldn't be able to use the '-shells' option. You'll<br>
  usually want to redirect the output of 'unshadow' to a file.</p>
<p> unafs DATABASE-FILE CELL-NAME<br>
  Gets password hashes out of the binary AFS database, and produces a file<br>
  usable by John (again, you should redirect the output yourself).</p>
<p> unique OUTPUT-FILE<br>
  Removes duplicates from a wordlist (read from stdin), without changing<br>
  the order. You might want to use this with John's '-stdout' option, if<br>
  you got a lot of disk space to trade for the reduced cracking time.</p>
<p> mailer PASSWORD-FILE<br>
  A shell script to send mail to all the users who got weak passwords. You<br>
  should edit the message inside before using.</p>
<hr>
<br>
So, that was about it... hope you've got something from this text.<br>
Further readings: try reading ALL the documentation you get with john in the docs<br>
directory. Maybe it's a little bit chaotic, but.... man those are the docs :)
<p><br>
  Ohh, wait, wait!!<br>
  Remember, not all password files can be cracked! Smart admins alter the<br>
  encryption that they are using, especially when it comes to root passwords.<br>
  But there are always other ways to get passwords. These are covered in other<br>
  BSRF tutorials. Collect them all (lol) at http://blacksun.box.sk.</p>
