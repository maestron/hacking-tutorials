<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b><br>
  <br>
  This guide is meant for Unix newbies who want to learn a little about basic 
  Unix security, and how to secure their box. Most systems come very very insecure 
  out-of-the-box. What is out-of-the-box (let's call it OOTB from now on), you 
  ask? An OOTB system is a system which was just installed. All the default configurations 
  are turned on, which means zero personalization (besides maybe a little personalization 
  made during the installation process) and quite a lot possible security problems. 
  Also, there are some very basic concepts that most newbie Unix users aren't 
  familiar with. </p>
<p>During this tutorial, I will teach you how to change default configurations, 
  basic packet filtering, how to secure your system's networking services (or 
  completely remove them or some of them, in case you don't need them, in order 
  to increate your computer's security), how to use, how to avoid trojans, what 
  are sniffers, how to maintain local security between different users in your 
  system (if you're not the only one using this system, whether it's locally or 
  remotely), some stuff about SSH, how to protect yourself against computer viruses 
  under the Unix system, what are security scanners and how to use them, why you 
  should encrypt your important data and how etc'. </p>
<p>Now, it is advised to go through Black Sun's previous tutorials (see blacksun.box.sk) 
  prior to reading this tutorial. They contain some basic concepts and terminology 
  which you need to know and you're might not familiar with. Also, you should 
  have some basic Unix knowledge and experience. If you don't have that kind of 
  knowledge yet, we advise you to go to the local computer store and buy a basic 
  Unix book (it shouldn't cost too much), or, if you really want to, order a specific 
  one from the Internet (or even better: go to blacksun.box.sk/books.html and 
  order a book from there. We get 15% of the money you pay... :-) This doesn't 
  mean that you pay more, though. We simply get 15% out of the money you pay). 
  Don't worry about online ordering, it's completely secure as long as you order 
  your books from Amazon.com (they're considered the most secure E-Store on the 
  planet, and I order lots of books from there).</p>
<p>Oh, one last note: this tutorial is in no way a complete one (Duh! It's a BASIC 
  tutorial, in case you havn't read the title). I included everything I could 
  possibly think of (that is notable for a beginners guide in this field, of course). 
  With time, I will add more chapters, so make sure you have the latest version 
  by visiting blacksun.box.sk often or subscribing to Black Sun's mailing list 
  (info on how to subscribe at blacksun.box.sk also).</p>
<p>Okay, heads up! Here we go!</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Setting The Ground</font></b><br>
  <br>
  First of all, I assume that you are using either RedHat Linux or Mandrake Linux. 
  Why is that? Because most Unix newbies use either of these two distributions. 
  Don't worry, it's no crime to use them or something, and it's not &quot;lame&quot;. 
  Each distribution has it's advantages. RedHat and Mandrake, for example, both 
  have simple installation and come with a lot of utilities built-in. That's okay, 
  although I like Slackware Linux and OpenBSD better (I'll explain why in a second).</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be asking right now &quot;but... but I have a different 
  distribution! Will this stuff work for me too?&quot;. Before I answer this question 
  (to the impatient ones of you, I can already say &quot;yes&quot;, but that's 
  not the exact answer. Read on and you'll understand), I want to explain what 
  is a distribution (otherwise known as a &quot;distro&quot; or a &quot;flavor&quot; 
  of Unix), why there are so many of them, where you could learn about all the 
  different distributions and how to choose the right distribution for you.</p>
<p>Unix was first distributed freely and in open-source form. If you're not familiar 
  with any programming language, then you're not familiar with the term &quot;source 
  code&quot;. I'll explain.</p>
<p>The simplest way to show you what source code is is to send you to a webpage. 
  Take hackernews.com (a personal favorite) for example. Every common browser 
  has an option to view the page's source from within the browser, but let's pretend 
  you don't know how to do this or you don't even have this option within your 
  browser. First, wait for the whole page to load. Then, save it to your hard 
  drive, a diskette or whatever. Then, open the HTML page you've just saved with 
  any text editor (Pico, KEdit, Emacs, Notepad, UltraEdit, whatever).</p>
<p>Now what do you see? No more text and graphics and colors and layout, but plain 
  good instructions. These are HTML instructions. HTML stands for Hyper Text Marquee 
  Language, and it is the language used to create HTML pages, which can be read 
  by your browser and used as instructions for how to build and display the web 
  page.</p>
<p><br>
  The same goes with programming. To create a program, you need to know some sort 
  fo a programming language (C, for example), and then construct the program using 
  commands which will later be given to a compiler (which will turn the source 
  code file into an executable binary file, or in other words, a program which 
  you can run and play around with) or an interpreter (the program runs as source 
  code, and gets executed by a program called an interpreter, which reads the 
  instructions in the source code and performs them. A popular interpreted programming 
  language is Perl. Interpreted programming languages usually run slower, but 
  have their advantages. We won't go into that now, though).</p>
<p>Okay, moving on. So now you know what source code is. As I've already explained, 
  Unix was initially distributed freely and in source code form. This means that 
  ANYONE with the right knowledge and skills can create his own version of Unix, 
  to meet his special needs. A different version of Unix is called a distribution, 
  a &quot;distro&quot; or a &quot;flavor&quot;.</p>
<p>Now go to www.linuxberg.com. Pick the closest mirror site and then enter the 
  distributions page. It will display a list of Unix distributions, each one with 
  it's own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. This is all nice, but 
  what happens if people start creating versions of Unix without paying attention 
  to compatibility issues? For example, if I would have created my own version 
  of Unix and called ls (the command that lists all files in the current directory 
  in console mode (text-based interface) or in a virtual console (a console within 
  a graphical window)) &quot;list&quot; instead? This means that if someone would 
  have made a program that called the ls command for some purpose, it wouldn't 
  work anymore (unless I create a command called ls that calls my own command 
  - list. But in that case, I have to make sure that list has similar rules to 
  ls). See the problem?</p>
<p>Also, if I go to my friend's house, which could be using a different distribution, 
  how could I possibly use his computer if everything is completely different?</p>
<p>This is why there are standards. Every Unix distribution has to meet these 
  standards so it will be compatible with other versions. This is also why most 
  (if not all) of the stuff I am about to teach here will work in all distributions. 
  If you have a certain problem or question, ask in our message board (find it 
  at blacksun.box.sk).</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot... in the beginning of this section, I have clearly stated 
  that I like Slackware Linux and OpenBSD more than RedHat Linux and Mandrake 
  Linux. Why is that? Simply because they have some advantages, such as even mroe 
  stability, security, speed and encryption, and they top all the other distributions 
  in these fields. Of course, they are much harder to work with (have you ever 
  tried to install OpenBSD?! To a person who installed Mandrake Linux, which is 
  the easiest to install, and is almost as easy as installing Windows 95, it would 
  look like hell!!).</p>
<p>Okay, let's move on to the actual security information, shall we?</p>
<p><b><font size="4">First Thing's First: Local Security</font></b><br>
  <br>
  First of all, let's think: why would you want to improve your computer's local 
  security? Well, if you're the only one using this computer, and you don't intend 
  to let anyone into your computer (at least not intentionally), then you<br>
  should only read this chapter for pure knowledge. But if you're running a multi-users 
  system, you definetly should improve your local security.</p>
<p>What is local security? Well, better local security means that different users 
  on this computer, whether they are local users (they have local access to the 
  computer. They use a keyboard, a monitor and what-not that are directly connected 
  to the actual box, not through some sort of a local area network (LAN) or the 
  Internet) or remote users (users accessing your computer, whether legally or 
  not, using Telnet, SSH, RLogin etc' and through a local network or the Internet), 
  you need to increate your computer's local security.</p>
<p>Let's start with a basic lesson about file permissions.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Unix File Permissions And The Password File</font></b><br>
  <br>
  First of all, you need to learn about the way the system works with different 
  users. Here is a mini-tutorial out of the Byte Me page at my website that will 
  explain what and how the Unix password file works, thus explain to you a little 
  more about this subject.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Password files == world readable + how do password files 
  look like? </font></b><br>
  <br>
  First of all, a file that is world readable is a file that can be read by ANYONE 
  on the system, even the most inferior user. On most systems today, the password 
  file (usually /etc/passwd) is world readable. Does this mean ANYONE can get 
  the encrypted passwords and decrypt them? Definetly not! A password file consists 
  of several (or one) lines, when each line represents a user.</p>
<p>The password file looks like this:<br>
  username:password:uid:gid:free text:home directory:shell<br>
  Username - the user's username.<br>
  Password - the user's password, encrypted using altered DES encryption (can 
  be cracked in a matter of time, though [note: we'll get to cracking the password 
  file later]). UID - User ID. If your UID is 0, you have root priviledges (nothing 
  can stop you, and you can even type &quot;su username&quot; (without the quotes) 
  to become a different user. Type exit to return to your root shell after you're 
  done. Btw SU stands for Switch User). If two users have the same UID, they'll 
  have identical permissions.<br>
  GID - Group ID. The same as UID, with root being GID=0. GID let's you set ownership 
  patterns and access patterns for a group of users (or a single user) who have 
  different or identical UIDs but have the same GID. Free text - some free text 
  about the user. For info on how to exploit this field in order to get private 
  information about people, read the Info Gathering tutorial here. Home directory 
  - where the user's private configurations files are stored. Usually /root if 
  you are root, or /usr/your-username or /home/your-username if you're another 
  user. Shell - the program that gets executed once you log in. Usually a command 
  interpreter (a program that receives commands from you and executes them). </p>
<p>Now, most systems will make /etc/passwd world-readable, but don't put the passwords 
  in it. Instead, they will put a single character, such as *. The passwords will 
  be stored at the shadow file, which is not world-readable, and is usually stored 
  at /etc/shadow. The shadow file is identical to the /etc/passwd file, only it 
  has the encrypted passwords. Some shadowing programs can also improve the encryption 
  schemes, but that's not important to us right now.</p>
<p>The /etc/passwd has to be world readable if you want to:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Find out what's the username of a certain UID. Very useful in some situations. 
    For example: each file has an owner. The owner can change access patterns 
    for this file, or change it's ownership. Root can own all files if he/she 
    wants to. The owner's UID is inserted into the file. Programs such as ls (ls 
    stands for list. It views the contents of a directory. For more info about 
    it and it's uses, type &quot;man ls&quot; without the quotes on a Unix system) 
    can tell you who owns a file. If they don't have access to the password file 
    (programs run with your priviledges, unless they are SUID, in which case they 
    run with the priviledges of the user who SUIDed them. People try not to use 
    SUID, because it poses lots of security threats), they will only be able to 
    present you with the UID of the owner. But if they have access to the password 
    file, they can find the appropriate username for this UID.</li>
  <li>Find out information about people (what's their home directory, what's their 
    shell, what's written in their free text area etc').</li>
  <li>Etc' etc' etc'... be creative! 
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>EOF</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In case you're wondering, EOF stands for End Of File. This means that... well, 
  duh! End of file! That's it, you've just finished that nice little mini-tutorial. 
  Now I assume you want to learn how to change file permissions.</p>
<p>So, in order to change file permissions, you need to learn how to use the chmod 
  command. Now, I am about to guide you on the process of finding information 
  about Unix commands by yourself. It's quite easy.</p>
<p>Okay, let's try man first. Man stands for manual. Man is a command that displays 
  a manual page for a specified command. The syntax is: max command. For example: 
  man ls, man cd, man more etc'. So let's try to type man chmod. AHA! No man entry 
  for chmod... :-/ (some systems might have a man page for chmod)</p>
<p>Let's try using info. We type info chmod. AHA! This time, we're getting something. 
  So let's see... it says a little about the chmod command, but it doesn't explain 
  how to use it! Oh, wait, look at this - there are links within this guide. Simply 
  position your cursor within a word, a couple of words or a sentence that link 
  somewhere else (they always have a * in front of them) and hit enter. Keep following 
  links until you learn about chmod and about file permissions.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">unlevels</font></b><br>
  <br>
  I have decided to quote a nice mini-tutorial from the Byte Me page at my website 
  instead of just writing about runlevels all over again (I don't like doing things 
  twice).</p>
<p>What are Linux runlevels? If you've been paying attention to what your Linux 
  box does during startup, you should have noticed that it says: &quot;Entering 
  runlevel x&quot; (where x is a number between 1 and 5) at one point of the bootup 
  stage (after it mounts your root filesystem (your &quot;/&quot; directory) into 
  read-write mode, sets up sound, finds your kernel's module dependencies (never 
  mind that for now) etc'). A runlevel is a bootup/shutdown sequence. It consists 
  of a list of commands to run on startup and a list of commands to run on shutdown 
  (or when switching to different runlevels). <br>
  Now, first of all, let's see how you can switch runlevels. Bah, that's easy. 
  Simply type init x, where x is a number between 0 and 6. Runlevel 0 is for &quot;halt&quot; 
  (turning off your computer, if you have APM -Advanced Power Management, and 
  if you have APMD - APM Daemon, installed. All modern CPUs have APM), runlevel 
  6 is for reboot and the rest are various runlevels. 5 will bootup everything 
  - it will even automatically run X (by default, of course. You can change this). 
  Runlevel 1 is considered the single-mode runlevel. It does the least possible 
  (kinda like &quot;safe mode&quot; in Windows) and doesn't even require you to 
  enter a password (but only root can switch runlevels, so you have to be either 
  root or have physical access to the computer during startup (we'll get to that 
  later)). <br>
  Editing your runlevels list is different with every different distribution. 
  Usually it would go like this: <br>
  a) Go to /etc/rc.d/rcx.d/ (where x is the runlevel's number) and play around 
  within this directory. It contains symbolic links (kinda like shortcuts in Windows. 
  For more information about symbolic links (otherwise known as &quot;symlinks&quot;), 
  type man ln) to programs (including their parameters) that will be executed, 
  and symbolic links to programs that will be killed on shutdown. Play around 
  to find out more (but ALWAYS make backups!!). <br>
  You can also try this: <br>
  b) (this should work on most Linux boxes) Switch to the runlevel you want to 
  edit. Then type setup. Go to system services, and select/unselect the services 
  u want to run on startup and kill on shutdown). <br>
  Or this: <br>
  c) The easiest way - on some distributions, such as RedHat, you will be able 
  to type the command control-panel within an xterm (a &quot;virtual terminal&quot; 
  - a console window within X-Windows) and get a nice little window thingi with 
  lots of buttons and suchlikes. Find the button that says &quot;runlevel editor&quot; 
  when you put the mouse above it for a second or two. Then click on this button 
  and play around with the programs. I'm sure you'll figure out how to use it 
  yourself. It's quite self-explanitory, and it contains help files and documentation 
  if you really need help. <br>
  Anyway, you can always try running the command: <br>
  find / -name *rc* -print <br>
  If none of the three specified methods didn't work, so you could see where your 
  runlevel directories are and apply method a on them. </p>
<p>And now, for a nice little runlevels-related hack. <br>
  Now, if you're reading this document, you're probably a Linux newbie, so you 
  probably use Redhat Linux, Mandrake Linux etc'. If so, you should have a prompt 
  saying &quot;boot:&quot; or &quot;LILO boot:&quot; or &quot;LILO:&quot; when 
  you start your computer, and you could either type Windows or Linux (you can 
  change these names into, say, sucky-OS for Windows and Stable_and_secure_OS 
  for Linux, or anything else you want. Use the linuxconf program to edit LILO's 
  preferences, and use your imagination... :-) ). Now, what happens if you type 
  linux 5? Of course! It boots up Linux in runlevel 5!! But wait! What happens 
  if you type linux 1 or linux single? It runs on runlevel 1 - single user mode, 
  which means... automatic root access! No password needed. :-) <br>
  Of course, you can change runlevel 1 by going to /etc/rc.d/rc1.d and then removing 
  the contents of this directory and copying everything from another runlevel 
  (replace the number in rc1.d to any other runlevel number). Please read cp's 
  manual page and make sure you're copying symbolic links as links and not as 
  files. <br>
  Of course, anyway, if you have local access to a Unix box (or any other box 
  that I know of, as a matter of fact), you can boot from a floppy (unless, of 
  course, the first boot device is a hard drive and the bios is password-protected, 
  but these can be hacked too. Refer to this guide). </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p>EOF</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, imagine that some evil cracker (e.g. your grandma... :-) ) reads this 
  document and then locally roots your computer somehow (the verb 'to root' means 
  'to get root access to a computer, not necessarily one that runs Unix'). Scary, 
  huh? That was as easy as stealing a candy from a baby (not that I've ever done 
  that... /me looks away... :-) ).</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Cracking The Password File</font></b><br>
  <br>
  As you should already know by now, the password file has some encrypted text 
  within it. Let's discuss about the encryption scheme first, shall we?</p>
<p>Unix password file encryption is based on an altered version of DES encryption. 
  If you will try to decode an encrypted Unix password (let's call it a hash from 
  now on. That's the proper name for it) using standard DES decoding, you will 
  get a null string. Nothing. Nada. Zero. No, not even zero. You simply won't 
  get anything.</p>
<p>So how do you open this door? With a key. :-) Key-based encryption (e.g. PGP, 
  which stands for Pretty Good Privacy, and has very powerful encryption schemes) 
  is an encryption scheme where you need to have a key, which is a set of letters 
  (lowercase or uppercase), numbers, symbols etc' (it could be just numbers, symbols 
  and lowercase letters, all letters, etc').</p>
<p>So in Unix &quot;crypt&quot; (from now on, crypt means Unix password file encryption), 
  the key is actually the first eight characters of the user's password (you can 
  add extra characters to the key, which can be generated randomly, for extra 
  security. These are called salts. I won't explain much about them here because 
  I don't believe I know enough about them to do so), so you need the user's password 
  to decode the hash (but if you have the user's password, why would you want 
  to decode his hash if you already have the password? :-) ).</p>
<p>So, crypted passwords cannot be cracked, right? WRONG! You can use a password 
  cracker such as John the Ripper or Cracker Jack (there are both Unix versions 
  and Windows versions. Sorry, I don't have URLs to download them) to crack the 
  hashes. But how do these things work?</p>
<p>A password cracker generates random passwords and then tries to break the hash 
  by using this password as the key. If it fails, it simply tries another password 
  until it gets it right. Password crackers can try thousands of passwords per 
  second on modern computers.</p>
<p>there are two methods of password cracking - brute-force and dictionary attacks. 
  In brute-force mode, your password cracker guesses passwords systematically. 
  You can set a minimum amount of characters for the password, and tell your cracker 
  what to create the password out of (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, 
  symbols etc'). In dictionary attacks, your password cracker takes words out 
  of a simple text file called a 'dictionary file'. Each line in this file represents 
  a single word for the password cracker to try.</p>
<p>Dictionary files usually have an advantage over brute-force attacks, because 
  if you know that the target's password has something to do with dogs, you could 
  download a dictionary file about dogs. If you know it's the name of some philosopher, 
  you could download a dictionary file containing the names of all known philosophers. 
  You can also download all-purpose dictionaries that contain various words (these 
  usually have the greatest chance to succeed). The best place to download wordlists 
  from is theargon.com.</p>
<p>So, as you can see, if someone obtains your hashes somehow, he could decode 
  them and break into your computer. This is why all users on your system should 
  have a long password, and preferably not a dictionary word.</p>
<p>If you need help with using a password cracker or have any further questions, 
  try asking them on the message board at blacksun.box.sk (it's ours, btw... :-) 
  ).</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Trojans</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Yes, trojans. Most people who read this might be thinking about Netbus, Back 
  Orifice, Sub7 and other Windows trojans. These aren't trojans. Okay, I mean, 
  they ARE trojans, but not this kind of trojans. They are 'remote administration 
  trojans'. First, let's understand what this name means, and then you'll see 
  what they have to do with Unix in general and with local<br>
  security in particular (as well as remote security). Let's start with the word 
  trojan:</p>
<p>Trpjan - In the Greek mithology, There is a story about the 'trojan horse'. 
  The Greek were trying to capture the city of Troy for a reason which is beyond 
  this guide (you should really read the whole story or get the movie or something. 
  It is quite good). They were camping on the outsides of Troy for about ten years 
  and they still didn't manage to get in. Then, they came up with a brilliant 
  plan: the whole army pretended to be leaving the area, and they left a giant 
  wooden horse for the Trojans as some kind of a present (to honor the Trojans 
  for being so good). Within this horse sat a couple of soldiers. When the Trojans 
  found the giant horse, they carried it inside and then, under the cover of night, 
  the soldiers inside it came out, opened the city's gates and let the entire 
  Greek army get in, which eventually lead to the fall of the city of Troy.</p>
<p>So, as you see, a trojan program is a program that does not do what it proclaims 
  to be doing. It could either be a harmless joke (a joke program that pretends 
  to delete your entire hard drive or any other kinds of computer joke programs) 
  or a malicious program which could harm your system.</p>
<p>Remote administration - To remotely administer a system means to be able to 
  work on this system as if you had local (&quot;physical&quot;) access to it. 
  Being able to remotely access your system (or &quot;to remotely login to it&quot;) 
  is useful for getting files off your system, working on your system from a distant 
  place etc'.</p>
<p>Remote administration trojan - A trojan program that let's the author of the 
  program, the person who sent you the program or any other person in the world 
  access your computer and remotely administer it (this is why Remote Administration 
  Trojans, or RATs, are often called remote administration &quot;backdoors&quot; 
  - they open a &quot;back door&quot; for the attacker to get in). This is exactly 
  like depositing your entire system and evertyhing on it to the hands of the 
  attacker.</p>
<p>The most dangerous thing about RATs would probably be that most of them (especially 
  Netbus and Sub7) are extremely easy to use and understand, and come with one 
  or two pages of instructions (yes, they're THAT simple), so any little kid can 
  use them. Most of these &quot;kids&quot; have no idea what this program or other 
  programs that do most of the work for them do, which lead to the nickname &quot;script 
  kiddies&quot; - &quot;lamers&quot; (a lamer is a person who acts immaturely 
  or stupidly) with programs that do all of the work for them. Technically, a 
  script kiddie can crack into the Pentagon if he is given a program that does 
  everything for him. But does he know how this whole thing works? Will he know 
  what to do once he's in? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Now, malicious trojan programs can do a lot more than that. There are also 
  trojans that allow the attacker to have local access to any user who runs the 
  program (if root runs it, the whole system is doomed. This is one of the reasons 
  why no sensible system administrator would work as root all the time, and instead 
  make himself a less-priviledged account to work with). This is useful if the 
  attacker has an account on this system and wants to get access to some other 
  user's files (or even root access, which means access to practically everything).</p>
<p>Also, if you gain write access to a commonly-used application (such as su, 
  which let's you run a sub-shell as another user by simply giving his password 
  instead of having to relogin. SU stands for Switch User. Oh, by the way, root 
  doesn't need to supply a password to su if he wants to gain access to some other 
  person's account), you can trojan these applications. Let's take su for example 
  - if you manage to change su so it'll send you every username and password which 
  it received, you could eventually capture your target's password or even root's 
  password.</p>
<p>So, kids, this is why you should beware of trojans. Be very careful with what 
  you run. Also, there are programs called checksum checkers. These programs perform 
  periodical tests (once a day, once an hour, once a week etc, depending on how 
  you configure them) that determine if the size of some applications (you can 
  descelect default applications to test or add new applications by yourself) 
  has changed. If someone has trojaned one of those applications, it's size should 
  change, but it is also possible (although much harder) to trojan a program without 
  affecting it's size, but that's out of the topic of this guide.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Unix Viruses</font></b><br>
  <br>
  The computer virus problem is much less harsh under the Unix platform, but if 
  you want to keep your data intact, you should be aware of the problem, which 
  still exists.</p>
<p>There is an incredibly small number of viruses in the wild for the Unix operating 
  system (a virus that is &quot;in the wild&quot; is a virus that has gone through 
  a network of any kind and started infecting computers on this network, just 
  like a biological virus, when it escapes a restricted laboratory environment 
  and goes into &quot;the wild&quot; and starts infecting people). This is because 
  virus writers are less motivated to write viruses for Unix, because of<br>
  the following reasons:</p>
<p>A) Most people who use Unix are more mature than other computer users. Virus 
  creators who intend to infect other computers are immature people.</p>
<p>B) Because of access restrictions in the Unix operating system, if a user runs 
  a file that is infected with a virus, the virus can't go far, and it can only 
  do what this user has priviledges to do (although, if a root-priviledged user 
  runs a virus, it can infect the whole system and freely travel to other systems). 
  So, because there are files that some users can access and some other users 
  can't, Unix viruses can't spread far.</p>
<p>Still, the problem exists, and we want to protect our data, right? This is 
  why you should still get yourself a Unix virus scanner. Because of the extreme 
  lack of viruses in the Unix system, there are no &quot;big titles&quot; of virus 
  scanners. Try going to altavista.com and searching for Unix virus scanners. 
  Download some different ones and compare the quality of their scans and the 
  amount of resources they consume.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Encryption</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Encrypt your important files. Use PGP for better encryption.</p>
<p>If someone penetrates your computer's security, it will be much much harder 
  for him to get your important data if you encrypt it.</p>
<p>For more information about encryption, read Black Sun's encryption tutorials 
  at blacksun.box.sk (go to the tutorials page and then find the encryption section. 
  We have some guides for beginners about PGP and encryption in general).</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Remote Security</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Why would you want to improve your computer's remote security? DUH! If you ever 
  plan to hook your computer into a LAN, the Internet or any other kind of network, 
  you immediately increase the chance of you getting hacked. You should definetly 
  attend to your remote security (unless you like getting your ass<br>
  rooted).</p>
<p>Also, you should read the local security part first, since it contains a lot 
  of information you need to know before you read this, and also quite a few tricks 
  that work for both local security and remote security.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Remote Root Logins</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Before I explain to you what is the issue with remote root logins and how to 
  block them, I need to explain to you what a TTY is first.</p>
<p>Unix is a multi-users system, right? And on multi-users systems, many users, 
  each one with his own monitor or any other type of terminal, can work on the 
  same computer, right?</p>
<p>Now, this computer is obviously running more than one process (a process is 
  a running program), since it has multiple users on it. Each process receives 
  some input and sends out some output. Well, then, how will this computer know 
  which input is whom's and where to direct the output of each program? You wouldn't 
  want to receive the output of processes that other users are running, right? 
  (well, technically, if you're a malicious cracker, you'd love to receive the 
  output of other users' processes, but we're getting off-topic now).</p>
<p>This is why each user has a TTY. TTY stands for Terminal TYpe. Each user has 
  it's own TTY, which can be composed of letters and numbers. That way, the computer 
  knows where the input comes from (from which TTY) and where to direct the output 
  to.</p>
<p>Okay, first, let's make an experiment. Run a text-based console of an XTerm 
  window (a console window from within X-Windows, the popular Graphical User Interface, 
  or GUI, of Unix systems) and type the command who. This will show who is logged 
  into the system (his username), when he logged in and what is his TTY. By the 
  way, if you prefer a graphical version of the who command, try typing gw within 
  an XTerm or within a &quot;run command&quot; box in X. This program should come 
  with the gnome window manager.</p>
<p>Okay, let's move on. Now, that we know what TTYs are, let's edit the file /etc/securetty 
  with a simple text editor. Now, what do we have here? We have a list of all 
  TTYs that can log in as a root-priviledged user. My /etc/securetty file looks 
  like this:</p>
<p>tty1<br>
  tty2<br>
  tty3<br>
  tty4<br>
  tty5<br>
  tty6<br>
  tty7<br>
  tty8</p>
<p>Okay, let me explain myself. Your computer should have eight virtual consoles. 
  You can switch virtual consoles by pressing ctrl+alt+F1 for console #1, ctrl+alt+F2 
  for console #2 etc'. You can imagine how useful this could be.</p>
<p>Consoles #7 and #8 are usually reserved for graphical displays, so if you run 
  X, it should appear in #7, and if you run another X process, it should appear 
  in #8.</p>
<p>These eight local consoles have these TTYs: tty1 for #1, tty2 for #2 etc'. 
  Now, as you can see, my /etc/securetty file contains only those local TTYs, 
  so no remote user can login as a root-priviledged user into my computer, even 
  if he has all the usernames and the passwords.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if someone has all the passwords, he could log in as another 
  user and then use su to switch to root. So the /etc/securetty thing isn't exactly 
  some fail-proof method, but it'll block off some intruders.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Watching Your Processes</font></b><br>
  <br>
  If you intend to have several users logged into your system, you should really 
  watch for what they're running, and how much system resources they're hogging.</p>
<p>Here are a few methods to watch your users:</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Using PS</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Type in the command ps -aux. Quite a list, huh? Now, if you want it to be more 
  readable, try doing ps -aux | more or directing it's output into a file, like 
  this: ps -aux &gt; some-file-name. If you want to look for specific entries 
  within this list, try doing ps -aux | grep some-text and it'll display lines 
  within the output of ps -aux that contain some-text (or whatever you type in).</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, as far as I know, PS stands for ProcesseS.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Using Top</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Type the command top. Cool program, huh? Quite useful... you should have a whole 
  virtual console or a whole XTerm devoted exclusively for it.</p>
<p>If you prefer a graphical display, try typing gtop (a graphical version of 
  top that comes with the gnome window manager) or kpm (stands for KDE Process 
  Manager. Comes with the KDE window manager).</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Eavasdropping</font></b><br>
  <br>
  If you're a root-priviledged user and you want to see what the other users on 
  your system are typing, consider using a command called TTY Watch. It will eavasdrop 
  on the TTY of the user(s) you choose to eavasdrop on, and let you know exactly 
  what they're typing and exactly what they see on their monitors.</p>
<p>Try searching for the latest version of ttywatch at Packet Storm Security (packetstorm.securify.com), 
  Security Focus (securityfocus.com), Linux.Box (linux.box.sk), Astalavista (astalavista.box.sk) 
  etc'.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Playing With INetD</font></b><br>
  <br>
  First of all, you need to learn what network daemons are and what INetD is.</p>
<p>A daemon is a program similar to TSR programs on Microsoft platforms. TSR stands 
  for Terminate and Stay Resident. TSRs locate themselves on your computer's memory, 
  and then stay silent and watch everything. Once certain credentials are met, 
  the program awakes and does something. For example: when your free disk space 
  reaches less than, say, 200MBs, the program alerts you.</p>
<p>A daemon is the Unix equivelant of Microsoft's TSRs (well, actually, Unix and 
  it's daemons were around waaaaaaaaay before Microsoft DOS and later Microsoft 
  Windows started selling). So what is a network daemon? Well, obviously, it's 
  a daemon that watches for certain credentials that have something to do with 
  networks. Here are several examples:</p>
<p>Example #1: The telnet daemon. Usually listens for incoming connections on 
  port 23, and then, once this credential is met, it displays a login screen to 
  the second party. Once the second party enters the correct combination of a 
  username and a password, it is given a shell environment, where it can interact 
  with your computer and run commands on it.</p>
<p>Example #2: The FTP daemon. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and makes 
  it easier for different computers to exchange computer files. More info on my 
  FTP security for extreme newbies tutorial (blacksun.box.sk/ftp.txt).</p>
<p>Example #3: A firewall is also a network daemon. Firewalls are programs that 
  filter incoming and outgoing network packets. They awake once a network event 
  occurs, and decide whether to allow or disallow it.</p>
<p>Now, let's think. Suppose you have twelve different network daemons on your 
  system. That would take up too much memory for us, right? Then why not just 
  have a single daemon to do all the ditry work for us and consume less memory? 
  This is where INetD comes into the picture.</p>
<p>INetD stands for InterNet Daemon. You can configure inetd by editing /etc/inetd.conf 
  (conf stands for configurations). This file should contain instructions on how 
  to edit it.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Updating Your Network Daemons</font></b><br>
  <br>
  You've just got the latest version of your favorite Unix distribution. It came 
  with an FTP daemon, which you want to run on your system so you could turn it 
  into an FTP server. But then, someone discovers a hole within this FTP daemon, 
  and a new version with a fix for this problem goes out. You don't wanna get 
  caught with your pants down, running an old and buggy FTP daemon, right? Hell, 
  you could get cracked by some script kiddie and lose your entire hard drive! 
  We don't want THAT to happen, now do we?</p>
<p>First of all, you need to know when a new hole is discovered. You should watch 
  packetstorm.securify.com on a daily basic, and also subscribe to the BugTraq 
  mailing list (securityfocus.com). You should also look for mailing lists concerning 
  the network daemons (also referred to as network services) you are using.</p>
<p>Then, once there are new versions of the network daemons you use, you should 
  download the latest version and update the files on your system.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Network Sniffers</font></b><br>
  <br>
  For an excellent paper on network sniffers (what are they, how can they risk 
  your computer's security and how to fight against them), read this excellent 
  paper: blacksun.box.sk/sniffer.txt.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">DO NOT Use Telnetd!</font></b><br>
  <br>
  DO NOT run the telnet daemon on your system! If you want people to be able to 
  remotely login to your system and run commands on your system, DO NOT use telnet 
  for this purpose.</p>
<p>Instead, you should use SSH (SSH stands for Secure SHell). SSH encrypts your 
  sessions, so it'll be harder for intruders to eavasdrop you and/or capture any 
  passwords you enter.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to use a special client for SSH, since SSH is very different 
  than telnet, because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>A) SSH encrypts your sessions. Telnet merely creates plain-text TCP sessions. 
  B) SSH runs on port 22 by default, while telnet stays on port 23. Although almost 
  every telnet application in existence allows you to create telnet sessions with 
  any remote host and port specified, some telnet applications still use port 
  23. Anyway, ALL telnet applications have port 23 as their default, so if you 
  type telnet some-host or telnet some-ip, it'll telnet to that host/IP and into 
  port 23.</p>
<p>Get sshd and ssh clients at packetstorm.securify.com, securityfocus.com, linux.box.sk, 
  astalavista.box.sk etc'.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Basic Packet Filtering</font></b><br>
  <br>
  First, find these two files: /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny. These two 
  files can be used to form a basic packet filtering system. Let's start with 
  /etc/hosts.deny first.</p>
<p>Each line in this file should look like this: host:service</p>
<p>Host - a hostname or an IP. You can also use wildcards. For example: *.aol.com 
  would stand for every host that has a hostname that ends with aol.com.</p>
<p>Service - what network service(s) do you want to allow/deny to this host? Services 
  are defined by their port number. You can also put ALL instead to block of EVERY 
  well-known port to this host (a well-known port is any port between 0 and 1024. 
  These ports are called well-known ports because each one has a default network 
  service associated with it. For example: port 23 is the default for telnet, 
  port 21 is the default for FTP, port 25 is the default for Sendmail, port 110 
  is the default for POP3 etc').</p>
<p>Each line within this file represents a combination of a host and a port(s) 
  that you don't want this host to be able to access. This is called basic packet 
  filtering.</p>
<p>Now, the /etc/hosts.allow file works exactly like hosts.deny, only it contains 
  hosts that you want to allow access to. Here are a few examples of why you would 
  need such a thing:</p>
<p>Example #1: You want to block every well-known port to AOL users besides port 
  21, so they could access your FTP server. To do this, you put *.aol.com:all 
  in your hosts.deny file and then *.aol.com:21 in your hosts.allow file. As you 
  can see, hosts.allow has a higher priority than hosts.deny.</p>
<p>Example #2: You want to block off AOL users from your FTP server on port 21, 
  besides foobar.aol.com, which is actually quite nice and always has something 
  interesting to contribute to your FTP collection. To do this, you put *.aol.com:21 
  in hosts.deny and foobar.aol.com:21 in your hosts.allow file.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Advanced Packet Filtering</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Yup... firewalls.</p>
<p>Firewalls are programs that watch everything that comes in and out of your 
  network or personal computer, and decide what to allow and what to block. Out 
  of their nature, firewalls need root-priviledges to run (or admin priviledges 
  on NT networks).</p>
<p>Firewalls usually come with a set of premade rules files. Rules files are files 
  with rules on what to allow and what to deny. These rules files can block DoS 
  attacks and relatively popular methods of hacking. Also, most firewalls come 
  with a 'learning mode' option, which is a way of defining your rules as you 
  go on (whenever something comes in or out, you are asked to either allow or 
  deny it, and the firewall adapts itselfs to your preferences).</p>
<p>One of the best firewalls for Unix (and one of the best firewall in the world) 
  is IP Chains. Search for the latest version at packetstorm.securify.com (search 
  for ipchains, not ip-chains or ip chains or anything. Otherwise, you probably 
  won't find anything), securityfocus.com or linux.box.sk.</p>
<p>For help using ipchains (ipchains isn't exactly the most user-friendly firewall 
  in existence), get some ipchains howtos (a howto is a document on how to do 
  something or how to use something), which probably come with the ipchains package 
  anyway, together with the executables, the configurations<br>
  files etc'. These howtos should help you a lot. You should also get a front-end 
  for ipchains if you're a first-time user.</p>
<p>Some people will argue and claim that other packet filtering firewalls, such 
  as BSD's ipfilter, are better than ipchains. However, I still consider ipchains 
  as my firewall of choice.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">DoS Attacks</font></b><br>
  <br>
  DoS stands for Denial of Service. DoS attacks deny access to a certain service 
  for a certain person. DoS attacks can crash your computer, disconnect you, crash 
  your web server programs, SMTP server programs, POP3 server programs etc', disallow 
  you access to your Email account (a mailbomb (flooding someone with enormous 
  amounts of Emails. Usually done with some sort of a program which<br>
  automates this progress) is also considered a DoS attack (although somewhat 
  privitive) because it fills up your mailbox and denies you access to it), block 
  certain remote services and in general anything you can think of that will deny 
  you access to something.</p>
<p>To protect yourself against DoS attacks, I recommend either:</p>
<p>a) Getting a good firewall (see previous section).<br>
  b) Subscribing to security mailing lists and checking online databases<br>
  frequently to get the latest versions of everything and all the latest patches.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Security Scanners</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Security scanners automatically test the security of a network by attempting 
  to crack into it in different popular ways. It is advised to run one on your 
  network or home PC (unless you don't run any services on your system, which 
  makes your system much less vulnerable, in which case there is no need to be<br>
  so paranoid. Just avoid default configurations and read all the rest of the 
  sections and you're pretty much safe) to test it's security, although just running 
  one isn't enough to secure oneself (follow the rest of the instructions in this 
  text and read some other texts and books. This text is in no way complete (ahem... 
  the name is BASIC Local/Remote Unix Security). Try some of the stuff at blacksun.box.sk's 
  books page).</p>
<p>In the next part, I will review some of the best scanners available at the 
  time this tutorial was written, although not in much depth and detail, since 
  I am limited in size and time.</p>

<p>* Why would you want to establish a written security policy? Because if you're 
  running an office network or some other kind of widely-used network and you 
  plan to sue anyone who would hurt or try to hurt the integrity of your network 
  than a written and published security policy would be the first thing you'll 
  need in order to sue.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Appendix B: Using Different Loggers</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Suppose your network or home PC have been compromised and broken into. What's 
  next? Surely you would like to sue the bastard, or at least find out how exactly 
  they got in. Or perhaps someone is inside your system right now and you want 
  to look for anything suspicious.<br>
  For any of the two, you will need the kind of evidence found in log files. But 
  what if the attacker has erased all forms of evidence of his mischevious acts 
  (which is very probable)? Most attackers will do that using automated log cleaners, 
  which will delete their presense from the log files. But what if you're using 
  something the attacker nor the creator of the log cleaner hasn't been expecting? 
  I'm talking about another logger, which the automated tool will not detect and 
  mess with. If you are using another logger or a modified logger, it is most 
  likely that script kiddies won't notice it, and only real crackers will notice 
  it and get read of their presense in your logs. This will increase the chance 
  that you will get to keep your logs.</p>

<p>That's about all for this time, folks. As I have already stated in the introduction 
  (actually, the next part was copied and pasted from the introduction chapter): 
  &quot;I included everything I could possibly think of (that is notable for a 
  beginners guide in this field, of course). With time, I will add more chapters, 
  so make sure you have the latest version by visiting blacksun.box.sk often or 
  subscribing to Black Sun's mailing list (info on how to subscribe at blacksun.box.sk 
  also).&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, some of you might have been expecting me to mention the r* 
  services (rcp, rlogin, rsh etc'), which don't exactly have perfect security. 
  Well, I was thinking of writing a tutorial completely devoted to them. If you're<br>
  interested, you could go to blacksun.box.sk right now and see if it's already 
  done (if it's not, most chances are that because there are other tutorials scheduled 
  ahead of it).</p>
