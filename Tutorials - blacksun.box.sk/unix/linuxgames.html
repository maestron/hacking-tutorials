<p><b><font size="4">Description</font></b><br>
  <br>
  A guide for all of those Linux people who want to have all of their games on 
  Linux but just don't know where to go and what to do.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Are you feeling rather... bored with your Linux system? How about adding some 
  entertaining values to it? Yes, I'm talking about computer games. Games? Games 
  for Linux, you ask? Sure, why not! And I'm not talking about minesweeper clones, 
  I'm talking about the real stuff!</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Okay, now where do I get them?</font></b><br>
  <br>
  The best place to go for your Linux games news is <a href="http://www.linuxgames.com" target="_blank">http://www.linuxgames.com</a>. 
  Also check out <a href="http://www.lokigames.com" target="_blank">http://www.lokigames.com</a> 
  - they sign contracts with game companies and get the source codes of games 
  and then port them to Linux. Quake, Civilization, Railroad Tycoon, Unreal, Heroes 
  of Might and Magic, they and more all have Linux ports.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Yeah, yeah, but what about those smaller games?<br>
  </font></b><br>
  Oh, you mean your solitaire and minesweeper. Office games, yeah... you still 
  want them? Here are some of the things you might want to download and places 
  you might wanna go to: <a href="http://pysol.tsx.org" target="_blank">http://pysol.tsx.org</a> 
  - PySol: currently has 160 (!!) card games, plus their rules, how to play, tutorials, 
  hints and everything you could possibly want. Also download the sound server 
  for it - they put a lot of effort in sound, and it's really worth it! You want 
  more? Try Linuxberg's games page. Try the games for the Gnome, KDE and X11 window 
  managers. http://www.linuxberg.com. Linuxberg is TUCOWS's version of TUCOWS 
  for Linux, by the way. Still more? Alright, remember space invaders? Yeah, that 
  game where you're a little spaceship in the bottom of the screen and little 
  alien ships shoot you from above, and you have to kill them all before they 
  reach you? Well, Linux has a 3D version of this game (some people just have 
  too much free time!). It's called XInvaders3D. Unfortunately, I don't have a 
  URL... just run a search for it.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">What about emulators?</font></b><br>
  <br>
  You like playing game machines games on Linux? You know, all those Nintendo 
  games? Or perhaps arcade machine games? All of your favorite emulators have 
  Linux versions. Take snes, the Super Nintendo (16 bit) emulator - it also has 
  a Linux port, of course, and it is called snes9x. Also get the KDE front-end 
  for it - ksnes9x. Run a web search for it. For arcade machine games, check out 
  XMAME (yes, it's mame for Linux) - <a href="http://x.mame.net" target="_blank">http://x.mame.net</a>. 
  You want your Nintendo 64 games? Run your favorite Windows Nintendo 64 emulator 
  from Linux using Wine, the Windows emulator. <a href="http://www.winehq.com" target="_blank">http://www.winehq.com</a>.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">What if...</font></b><br>
  <br>
  You're looking for a game, but you just can't find a Linux port? No problem! 
  You can try to emulate it using Wine from <a href="http://www.winehq.com" target="_blank">http://www.winehq.com</a> 
  or using VMWARE (practically one of the most amazing things I have ever seen... 
  try it. Seeing is believing) from <a href="http://www.vmware.org" target="_blank">http://www.vmware.org</a>.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">I'm having trouble installing something!</font></b><br>
  <br>
  First of all, see if you got any readme or install files with the package (often 
  called README or INSTALL). If not, check the game's homepage. If you still can't 
  install it, try posting a message to the message board at http://blacksun.box.sk.</p>
