1.0 Introduction</font>
</p>
<p><b>1.1 About this tutorial -</b> This is a tutorial on the files found in the
/etc directory on UNIX systems. It is based on BSD (FreeBSD 4.2 to be exact) so
it might not be exactly the same as your Linux, Solaris or *BSD box. However
there should be some similarities, hopefully enough that this is useful at
least. NOTE* It is now 1 Am, I am on very little sleep and to much caffeine,
mistakes might happen. I will what I can to catch them but I am not responsible
if anything from this tutorial (or anything else) happens to damage your operating
system, you, or your pet dog Fluffy.</p>
<p><b>1.2 About the Author - </b>I ( Digital Fallout ) work an an ISP where I
have the privilege to work on a variety of computers including UNIX. Some people call
me a hacker, some call me weird, both terms are fine my me. I consider myself
just a geek
who happens to like UNIX and probably knows a bit more than yourself, that all. I am not some UNIX gift from god, I just find it
interesting.</p>
<b>
<p>1.3 Opening Notes - </b>Like I said earlier, I am not responsible for
anything that may become from this tutorial. It is your computer, these are just
my thoughts/ideas. I don't can can't grantee the accuracy of all the
information in this tutorial. As errors become apparent, I will revise and re-release
it to make it a more resourceful document. Again, mess with these files at your own risk, there is a reason
you need to be root to mess with these files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font SIZE="4">
<p>2.0 Basic Unix File System</p>
<p></font><b>2.1 ETC - </b>The files located in the /etc directory of UNIX are
mostly made up of configuration and system information files. That makes these files
very important. Do not edit them unless you know what you are doing. I have had to
reinstall Linux many a times because some change I made locked me out of my own
system.</p>
<b>
<p>2.2 Everything Else - </b>I am more than aware of the rest of the UNIX file
system but there is simply to much to go over in this tutorial. Perhaps I will
create other tutorials to go over these files but for now, reference your
documentation, that can explain things better than I ever will be able to.</p>

<p>3.0 Final Notes</p>
</font>
<p>Following are descriptions of specific files grouped by their basic function.
Some are extremely detailed wile others are barely mentioned. This if for three
reasons. #1, it isn't that important of a file for what you will probably be
doing. That is, you probably wont mess with it regardless of wither or not you
know what it does. And #2 is that I am not&nbsp; knowledgeable about that
file. Yes, I still have allot to learn about UNIX, I am just trying to help you
out with what knowledge I do have. And Finally, #3, maybe it is just that simple
:) Also, for more information about most ( if not all ) of these files, look at
the man pages associated with these files. Time man &lt;file name&gt; or man man
for more information about the man command. ( get all of that? ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font SIZE="4">
<p>4.0 Files</p>
<p>4.1 </font><b>Internet Related</p>
<p>4.1.1 ftpusers - </b>This is a file that will list all users that are not
allowed to access the FTP server. Some users/daemons are added by default such
as BIND, games, and pop.</p>
<p><b>4.1.2 services - </b>This file lists a complete ( if not near-complete )
set of services and what ports they run on. Examples are FTP, HTTP, and finger.</p>
<p><b>4.1.3 netstart - </b>Netstart is an obsolete file ( made so by rc.network
) but is still installed in case you would like to start the network manually in
case for example, you are in single user mode.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p></font><b>4.1.4 networks -</b> Networks holds a database of your local
networks</p>

the rules that would allow a computer to connect.</p>

users</font>

<font SIZE="2">
that you would allow to connect to your computer.</p>
<p><b>4.1.7 hosts.lpd - </b>This file has a list of hostnames and IP addresses
that are allowed to use your print services.</p>
<p><b>4.1.8 inetd.conf -</b>This file contains all the daemons your computer has
running ( and ones that have been disables ). It is a prime target for hackers because this
is the file that UNIX checks to see what it should do with a connection
on a given port ( Sendmail, POP3, FTP).</p>
<p><b>4.1.8 hosts.deny -</b>This file is used by the IP rule set to decide what
hosts to block access to the computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4.2 System Related</p>
<p>4.2.1 resolv.conf - </b>This file has a list of your DNS servers used for
resolving host names to IP addresses.</p>
<p><b>4.2.2 modems - </b>This is the modem configuration database.</p>
<p><b>4.2.3 motd - </b>See that text that scrolls by when you login? Look
Familiar? It is the same text as in the motd file. By editing this file, you can
change what text users see when they log onto your system.</p>
<p><b>4.2.4 aliases - </b>This file contains all the aliases used by sendmail.
The file actually exists in /etc/mail but is linked to /etc for convince.</p>
<p><b>4.2.5 shells - </b>The shell database exists in the file. All shells
installed on your system will appear in this file. Also note that any user not
using one of these shells is not allowed to FTP into the server.</p>
<p><b>4.2.6 hosts - </b>This file contains all the known hosts on the network.</p>
<p><b>4.2.7 auth.conf - </b>This file configures the kind of authentication that
UNIX should use.</p>
<p><b>4.2.8 newsyslog.conf - </b>Configuration file for newsyslog</p>
<p><b>4.2.9 crontab - </b>Crontab is used to schedule tasks to repeat at a given
interval. Crontab has fields for minutes, hours, days, and months.</p>
<p><b>4.2.10 csh.login - </b>This is the system wide .login file for the csh
shell</p>
<p><b>4.2.11 csh.logout - </b>As you may have guessed, this is the system wide
logout file for the csh shell. ( Surprise! )</p>
<p><b>4.2.12 syslog.conf - </b>This is the configuration file for the syslog
program.</p>
<p><b>4.2.13 dhclient.conf - </b>A required configuration file for the ISC DHCP

<p><b>4.2.17 usbd.conf -</b> The usbd.conf file is the configuration file for
the USB daemon.</p>
<p><b>4.2.18 login.access -</b> This is the login access control table</p>
<p><b>4.2.19 dm.conf - </b>The configuration file for the dm program.</p>
<p><b>4.2.20 ttys - </b>This is the terminal initialization information and is
used by some routines to use special files for the terminal,.</p>
<p><b>4.3 User Related</p>
<p>4.3.1 master.passwd - </b>This file looks allot like the normal passwd file
except<br>
it has the encrypted passwords in the second field</p>
<p><b>4.3.2 adduser.conf - </b>This is the configuration file for the adduser
script used<br>
to add user accounts.</p>
<p><b>4.3.3 adduser.message -</b> This is the message you can select to send to
new<br>
users when they first login.</p>
<p><b>4.3.4 group -</b> This is the database containing all the groups on your
system and who belongs in each group.</p>
<p><b>4.3.5 passwd -</b> This is the user database ( minus the password ) It is a
very important file and should be backed up regularly and check for compromises.</p>

<p>5.0 Closing Notes<br>
</font><font FACE="Times New Roman">I know this looks more like a reference guide than a tutorial but that is how I wanted it to be. I wanted this text to
be used &quot;on the spot&quot; so you can pick what files you need to know
about. If I decide to make further editions of this text I will include more
Linux type files in addition to the BSD ones you already see here. I am sure you see a
resemblance between my descriptions and the man pages for these
files. Good, that means you are doing some research by yourself, you learn
better that way anyways :)</p>

<font SIZE="2">
<p>Thanks to everybody who hangs out in the #BSRF chartroom ( irc.box.sk )
and The Black Sun Research Facility ( even though I help run it ) for giving me
someplace to publish this work. Special thanks goes out to Mikkkeee for helping
out with BSRF, Cyberwolf for the same reasons, AZTEK for helping me with all my
stupid PHP questions, Kript0n for just being cool :), Matt, RedShadow, ElfQrin,
Ghost Rider, and caboom for just being themselves. And finally MAJOR thanks
need to go out to cube from Box Network for without him there would be no Black
Sun or any other great opportunities he gives out. Thanks to you man :)</p>
