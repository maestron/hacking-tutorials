<p><b><font size="4"><a name="1"></a>Introduction to Novell Netware</font></b></p>
<p> Novell Netware is a server based operating system for networks. Unlike Unix 
  and NT, Netware isn't an all in one program. Let me explain. Netware itself 
  runs on top of a version of DOS. The version that you might be familiar with 
  is MS-DOS as this comes with Windows 95 and 98. Novell uses DR-DOS. This is 
  very similar to MS-DOS and even uses the same sort of commands. When a Netware 
  server starts up, first it loads up DR-DOS (also known as Caldera DOS because 
  Caldera wrote it). Once DOS is started, Netware is loaded which then sets up 
  the server itself. Once this has been done, the server is happily sitting on 
  the network and awaiting requests. Netware has two main admin areas. First is 
  the console and second is NDS.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="2"></a>What is the 'console' and 'NDS'?</b></font></p>
<p>The console is kind of like a DOS prompt. It takes commands in the same way 
  as you'd expect and it looks almost the same to. The prompt though (the bit 
  before you type in your commands) is somewhat different. In MS-DOS, you might 
  get a prompt like this:</p>
<table width="99%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td><pre>
C:\WINDOWS >
|	|
|	This bit is the directory you are currently in. Here, you can see I'm in the
|	Windows directory. Netware doesn't have this and I'll explain why a little later
|
The 'C:\' shows the current drive. Netware has something like this but it doesn't 
actually show you what drive you are in. Again, I'll explain this later.</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>You've seen what the MS-DOS version is like. Here then is a sample from a Netware 
  server named &quot;Gandalf&quot;.</p>
<p><b>GANDALF :</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The console is designed simply for managing the server itself. Not the files 
    or its users as can be done with an NOS (Network Operating System) such as 
    Linux. Commands entered here affect only the server that is in the prompt. 
    In this case, only server Gandalf will be affected by my commands.<br>
    You can run or 'load' programs into the server in the form of NLMs ( Netware 
    Loadable Modules). These can be seen as plugins for the server. Once run, 
    the program will automatically be set-up. I'm mentioning this now because 
    some of the best hacks require software to be loaded in at the server. I'll 
    cover this later though.<br>
    The console can also be access from another computer using a piece of software 
    called &quot;RCONSOLE&quot;. This is a DOS based program so you will need 
    to be able to run DOS programs on your machine. Many Admins disable this on 
    user accounts and only have it active on Admin accounts. Even if you can run 
    RCONSOLE, you will still need a password to access the server. Most servers 
    are left at the console so no logging in is necessary. However, servers tend 
    to be well guarded!</p>
  <p> NDS (Netware Directory Service) is where all the user and file information 
    is stored. It is usually referred to as the &quot;NDS Tree&quot;. You could 
    easily compare it to a telephone directory. The NDS Tree holds all the information 
    about a network. From the individual workstations to the users to the servers 
    and the files stored on them. Because everything in general is managed through 
    NDS, this is really the kind of access you want. Console access is useful 
    (you can kick people you don't like off the server) but having the ability 
    to alter anything on the network is much more fun. <br>
    The program that you need to access the NDS Tree is called 'nwadmn32.exe'. 
    This is usually available somewhere on the system because it isn't directly 
    a security risk. If you load it as a normal user, you will only have rights 
    to alter some parts of that user such as the password. You may not be able 
    to touch other peoples information but you can usually read it. I'll come 
    back to this later on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="3"></a>How do I know if they're running Novell?</font></b></p>
<p>This is an easy one. Before you can use any machine on a Novell network, you 
  must login. Novell like to show everyone just how good they think they are and 
  splash their name and their stupid red 'N' logo everywhere that they feel they 
  can get away with. This includes the login screen.<br>
  If for some reason you don't have this on your login screen but you still think 
  that you are on a Novell network, take a closer look at the login screen. Most 
  networks now use the latest client which supports contextless logins. Although 
  this sounds complicated it isn't. Normally when you login to Novell, you must 
  tell the server what 'context' you are in. This lets people have the same user 
  names. For instance for me to login to Gandalf I'd need to supply :</p>
<p>Miggyx.admin.users.abc</p>
<p><br>
  This is a short one. Many go much deeper than this and have six levels or more! 
  Problem is humans aren't too hot at remembering these long login names. For 
  this reason Novell brought out contextless logins. You pick an option from a 
  drop down menu then fill in only the user name. For instance :</p>
<table width="262" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td width="130">Context :</td>
    <td width="130">Server Admins</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="130">User :</td>
    <td width="130">miggyx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="130">Passwd :</td>
    <td width="130">******</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Instead of :</p>
<table width="262" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td width="130">User :</td>
    <td width="130">miggyx.admin.users.abc</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="130">Passwd :</td>
    <td width="130">******</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Basically it was all done to make users lives easier. This option never appears 
  on Unix or NT systems because they don't support multiple user names and thus 
  context is irrelevant. If your system has this on the login screen, you definitely 
  have Novell Netware.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="4"></a>I'm still not sure if I'm on a Novell network. 
  I have a normal user account. How can I check with this?</font></b></p>
<p> Yes you can and if you have a real account, it will make your life a lot easier. 
  It is easier to hack a system that you have some access to than to start from 
  scratch. Login and see if you have a little red 'N' in the taskbar. This is 
  Novell's little Admin tool for the user themselves and it has a few interesting 
  properties too which I'll cover later. If you have this 'N' you are definitely 
  on a Novell network. However some mean Admins turn off the nice little 'N'.<br>
  You can also right click on a network drive. A network drive is a directory 
  on a remote computer that has been made to look like a hard drive on your machine. 
  You'll find these in 'My Computer'. Right click on them. In this menu, there 
  will be several entries with the red 'N' next to them. Again this is a dead 
  give away that you are running on a Novell network.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="5"></a>Hmmmm..... I don't have an account. What 
  are the usual accounts and passwords and how do I find a valid account?</font></b></p>
<p> Well, there are quite a few standard user names and passwords that are used 
  on Novell networks. However not all of them are used and sometimes not one is 
  used. This list comes from the Netware Hack FAQ and I've found it to be quite 
  comprehensive :<br>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Some of these are used quite a lot of the time. ROOT is a good example because 
  it also ties in with superuser access on Unix and Linux servers. Having a user 
  called root is quite common now. Accounts by the name 'Admin' , 'Administrator' 
  and 'Manager' are in common use to.</p>
<p><b>How do I find out if an account is valid?</b></p>
<p> This is surprisingly easy. Type in the username you are trying to check. Type 
  in any password unless you know it ( if you know the password then the account 
  is obviously valid) and press enter. You will likely get an error message back. 
  If the message says something on the lines of &quot;Invalid password&quot; or 
  &quot;Unknown Error&quot; followed by a number , it is a fair bet that the account 
  exists. If you get the Unknown Error message, it is likely that the account 
  is there but has been locked out. This is also a cunning way of locking out 
  someone's account who you don't like.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="6"></a>How do I lock out my enemies accounts?</font></b></p>
<p> Well, this is particularly easy to do. Most Admins for security have a limit 
  on how many times someone can login incorrectly before the account gets locked 
  out. This is usually set to 5 times. Here's how you do it.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type in your friend /enemies login name.</li>
  <li>Put it an obviously wrong password. Anything will do.</li>
  <li>Hit 'Enter'.</li>
  <li>The computer should bounce back with an error about an invalid password. 
    This is what we want so keep going.</li>
  <li>Repeat from stage three until the server comes back with an unknown network 
    error. </li>
</ol>
<p>Once you get the unknown network error, you have successfully locked out the 
  account. It won't work again until an admin manually unlocks it. This could 
  mean a disabled account for hours or even days. Snik snik!</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="7"></a>Is there an easy way to get Admin access?</font></b></p>
<p>This only works on Netware 3.*. You use a program called NW-HACK.exe . A nice 
  little program that sits and waits till an Admin logs in and then creates a 
  nice account for you with super user access. You will be able to find this program 
  on the Internet but I'm not going to spend much time on it because it has a 
  full set of docs with the program itself.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="8"></a>What about the Net Plug attack?</font></b></p>
<p> This is an attack that I worked out myself before I was given Admin status. 
  It always works and I've yet to see it fail. Make sure you are at a windows 
  95 or 98 machine. I doubt NT would be fooled by this trick but I don't have 
  any NT machines so I can't test it for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note : Most Admins, believe that they are the most knowledgeable about their 
  system. Many also believe that no one else knows much about computers. In other 
  words, for whatever reasons, they are not too concerned about us i.e. the idiots 
  attacking their servers. Why? Because we aren't good enough. So why waste valuable 
  time configuring security that won't be needed eh? I think I've made my point. 
  They don't see us as a threat. You don't consider a house spider a threat so 
  you don't go round putting up netting to keep them out. Why? You can't be bothered. 
  The same rule applies here. Even if you are a computer genius, play it dumb. 
  Admins like to lecture the uninitiated and would love to appear smarter than 
  you. This is the way you want it. The Admins will think you're a nice guy or 
  gal, totally harmless. This sometimes gives you more leverage because they like 
  you, they'll be willing to help you. They also won't expect you to launch a 
  huge assault on their servers either However sometimes there are some smart 
  people out there who will notice your talents and pull you over to their side. 
  This isn't a bad place to be and can be advantageous later.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all, login as yourself. Crash your computer and reset it . Walk over 
  to your favourite admin (the one that hates you most is the best choice ) and 
  apologise for being an idiot but the computer won't let you login and could 
  s/he please come and take a look for you. Mumbling and grumbling they'll come 
  over. The best way to test if it is the machine is for them to login. Of course, 
  they'll log in as an admin or equivalent. They'll check your account and see 
  that your account is fine. They'll tell you to log onto another machine and 
  your account will be okay. They'll now log off and walk off in disgust thinking 
  you are a computer moron. Not so my friend, we've just done them good and proper!<br>
  Turn off the computer and pull out the network lead. Turn it back on again. 
  The computer will detect that you aren't on a network and will dump you at a 
  desktop with restrictions of the last user. If this user is the admin then chances 
  are that he or she will have full access to everything including DOS and drive 
  access. Perfect for installing all those really kewl programs you have on a 
  disk in your pocket......<br>
  But you aren't on the network now. That's no fun is it? Shove the lead back 
  in and try to access a network drive. This is the bit where you hope the Admins 
  are sloppy or not computer geniuses. Windows by default caches ALL passwords 
  so unless the Admins have told it not to ( a key deep in the registry) then 
  windows will have a nice copy of their password. Go into 'My Computer' and click 
  on a drive. Whoop with glee as Netware logs you in as an Admin. Why does this 
  happen? Well windows still holds the username and password last used to access 
  the drive. You are logged into windows as Admin and windows knows what credentials 
  you last gave to the server. So it supplies them for you. Likewise because you 
  are now authenticated you know have full access to the NDS tree. Not only can 
  you read but you can no write, modify delete etc etc. Much more fun!<br>
  Now, this is the bit where you have to be sneaky. You have to make a new account 
  for yourself or upgrade your old one. There are pros and cons to each of your 
  choices. If you alter your existing account and they check it for some reason 
  ( maybe you got locked out? ) they'll notice you have admin rights and shoot 
  you. If you make a new user, it might get found quicker but there is no way 
  to point to you ( it was created by user admin after all tee hee ). The choice 
  is yours. You can always do both.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="9"></a>What's a backdoor and is it useful to me 
  ?</font></b></p>
<p>A back door like the name suggests is a way into a system without going through 
  the front door. The front door being the proper way in. Your backdoor will give 
  you full access (or whatever it was set-up to do) without anyone else knowing 
  about it.<br>
  It is useful to you because it gives you a lot of power and anonymity. People 
  won't know that it was you that deleted that account or altered your reports. 
  You'll be like the ghost in the machine. Invisible and all powerful. Doesn't 
  that sound wonderful to you?</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="10"></a>Once I'm in, can I leave a back door?</font></b></p>
<p> Yes, there are many different ways of leaving a back door and may different 
  things a back door can be designed to do. Firstly, the most powerful backdoor 
  is the one that gives you full access to an entire system. Unfortunately, these 
  are the hardest to set-up (unless you did my Net Plug trick) and the Admins 
  aren't blind. They'll notice that a new admin account has appeared. Unless of 
  course you hide it. This isn't all that easy but it can be done. The second 
  type of backdoor gives you access to the server (like rconsole). These aren't 
  as powerful but they still have the ability to run things like the 'down' command. 
  The 'Down' command shuts the server down and dumps it at a DOS prompt. Another 
  powerful command is the load command. This sticks programs into memory. Unfortunately 
  all but the most stupid Admins log the console.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="11"></a>Leaving an Admin level user in the NDS Tree</font></b></p>
<p>This is the best way of hiding a user in the NDS Tree. Most Admins have only 
  been on the CNA (Certified Novell Administrator) course so won't have the expertise 
  to locate the user even if they did think that it existed. Even if they have 
  a CNE (Certified Novell Engineer) they aren't likely to find your user because 
  not only don't they know where to look, they won't know your user is there. 
  The best crimes aren't ones that you can get away with without being caught. 
  The best crimes are ones that the victim doesn't even know have happened.<br>
  Anyway, here is what you have to do :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get logged in as Admin or equivalent ( Use the Net Plug trick )</li>
  <li>In NWADMIN highlight an existing container.</li>
  <li>Create a new container inside this container.</li>
  <li>Create a user inside this new container. No home directory.</li>
  <li>Give this user full Trustee Rights to their own user object.</li>
  <li>Give this user full Trustee Rights to the new container.</li>
  <li>Make this user security equivalent to Admin.</li>
  <li>Modify the ACL for the new user so they can't be seen.</li>
  <li>Adjust the Inherit Rights Filter on the new container so no one can see 
    it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've not had the chance to really test this in the field. It worked for me 
  but whether or not it won't be detected in the field is another matter. It works 
  fine in theory though.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="12"></a>Okay, now how do I leave a backdoor into 
  the server itself?</font></b></p>
<p> This is a lot more difficult because you have to run a program on the server 
  itself. You do this by using the load command. It will automatically load the 
  program from the SYS: directory. You'd have to copy the files to this directory 
  first. Because this dir is filled with NLMs, it will be a lot harder to locate 
  your new program as a rogue. Problem is actually running it. As I said before 
  most Admins run the console logging program called CONLOG. So now what? If we 
  try anything it will be logged won't it? Sure, unless we turn off the logging 
  program first tee hee. Type &quot;unload conlog&quot; without the quotes. This 
  will stop logging console activity. Next type &quot;load magicfile.nlm&quot; 
  with the name of your program and without the quotes. Next type &quot;load conlog&quot; 
  again without the quotes. Loading up conlog is the last thing that you do before 
  leaving the server.<br>
  Some Admins run a program called &quot;Secure Console&quot;. This stops you 
  from loading any more programs. The only way to get round this is to use the 
  unload command again. However it is password protected. You can get past this 
  too but it will take some guts to do and it will take out the server for a few

<ol>
  <li>Type &quot;Down&quot; at the prompt. If there are any users logged in, it 
    will warn you. Press Y to continue or N to cancel. Pressing Y will cut them 
    off. Any system that is on the Novell network will report to its users that 
    the server is going down. Try to do this at the end of the day when all the 
    clients are turned off or when you've got a chance to reset them before someone 
    sees the message</li>
  <li>Turn the machine off</li>
  <li>Wait a few seconds</li>
  <li>Then turn it on again</li>
  <li>Run outside and wait for the server to come back up. It is not a good idea 
    to get caught with the server in this state.</li>
  <li>When the Admins rush in to find out why their precious server bit the dust, 
    their last concern is whether secure console is running or not.</li>
  <li>When they leave, wait a few minutes before going back in.</li>
  <li>Go to the console and turn off the console logger</li>
  <li>Run your nasty little program</li>
  <li>Turn the logging program back on</li>
  <li>Walk out of the room as a super user.</li>
</ol>
<p>The program itself will not show up in the logs ( because you stopped logging 
  before you ran it ). When they shut the server down, the program will not longer 
  be resident. However, if you are taking the risk to run this program, make sure 
  you also run something that will catch the rconsole password. Admins hardly 
  EVER change this. They are far more careful with the NDS password and see no 
  reason why anyone would be able to find or to use their little rconsole password. 
  Once you have the rconsole password you don't really need a backdoor.</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="13"></a>Accessing servers drives that you shouldn't 
  be able to see</font></b></p>
<p>When you are using Novell, you have your home area mapped as a network drive. 
  You can't press 'Up' to go higher because it will just take you to my computer. 
  How do you get around this and why would you want to?<br>
  Well, most Admins don't login to everyone's user account to check that they 
  are set-up correctly ( I know I wouldn't bother going through 1000 different 
  accounts in the unlikely case that one of them is messed up). If they aren't 
  set-up correctly, you might have access to other peoples home areas. Thing is 
  though, how do you get there? You can't see higher than your own directory.<br>
  First of all, you have to find out what server you are connected to. This is 
  pretty straight forward. Okay, go back to 'My Computer'. Right click on a network 
  drive and hit properties. It will tell you what server it is mapped on. I'll 
  use GANDALF as an example. My home directory is mapped to F:, however the real 
  location of my home directory is \\gandalf\data1\users\yr12_990\miggyx\ . Now, 
  I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't checked the properties. Admins usually 
  assume you won't know or won't bother looking. The server name directly follows 
  the '\\'. Go to the start menu and select run. Type in the server name. In my 
  example this would be \\gandalf. <br>
  What if those pesky Admins have removed the Run command? Not a problem. Minimise 
  all the windows so you are looking at your desktop. Right click and select New 
  -&gt; Shortcut. When asked what it should shortcut to, type in '\\servername'. 
  Press 'Enter' a few times. You should get an icon on your desktop. Click this 
  twice and it will pull up the server. Simple but effective. A word of caution 
  though. Delete the shortcut after use using shift+del. NEVER use just the delete 
  option. If you choose just to delete the file, it will go straight to the recycle 
  bin. Sometimes users don't have access to it and so can't remove the file themselves. 
  This is when those friendly Admins come along and see a nice shortcut to their 
  server with your name on it. Not a good thing to be doing. Shift + Del removes 
  the file directly. This also bypasses any logging software running on the machine 
  itself. The Admins won't be able to get to the file assuming they know it exists 
  in the first place. Best to play it safe. <br>
  Once you have access to the server itself ( albeit only as yourself and not 
  as an admin unless your admin is really stupid), you might be able to browse 
  around. For instance, I still had read access to everything in the \\gandalf\data1\users\yr12_990 
  directory. I could go in a read everyone's work ( although I couldn't write 
  to it) and pass it off as my own. Also, you'll be able to access some of the 
  system directories. In here you'll find useful tools such as rconsole, fconsole 
  nwadmn32.exe and others. Running nwadmn32.exe as yourself only gives you your 
  own rights to the NDS tree. The NDS tree ( Netware directory Service ) contains 
  everything on the entire network. Even if you've got very limited access, you 
  will still see the whole tree. This includes the usernames for the Admins and 
  all the services they are running. You may even have some ability to alter users 
  in your group. It all depends on how your system is configured. Either way it 
  can be a powerful information tool. Usually you can see everything but alter 
  nothing. This is still useful. For instance, say there is this gal you really 
  like and you would kill for her phone number and address. Why go through all 
  the hassle? Most Admins stick all information about a user into their network. 
  It makes sense really. Load up nwadmn32.exe ( they can't restrict this because 
  it would restrict all windows programs and that would be really stupid) find 
  her username and click twice. Bang, you can see all her details. Sure you can't 
  actually alter them but you can read can't you?<br>
  You should also be able to happily browse through the directories that you can 
  see. Even if you aren't logged in as an Admin, it is likely you can find some 
  fun files to play around with. If they need DOS access, you'd better log in 
  as an Admin. If you've read the above, you should be able to get Admin status.
