  <p align="left">Please direct all questions and suggestions to the message board 
    at blacksun.box.sk (this is the only message board I know that is completely

  <p align="left"><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b>
  <p align="left"><b>What are flames?</b>
  <p align="left">Flames are violent and aggressive responses to Email messages, 
    newsgroup messages, IRC messages or any other form of communication over the 
    Internet or any other computer network. Flames usually consist of bad words 
    (e.g. Shut the fuck up, R a v e N!), swearing (e.g. R a v e N, you are a complete 
    asshole!), cursing (e.g. Go to hell, fucker!!), censorship-like marks (e.g. 
    You can take your tutorials and shove them up your !#$^*&amp;!! Why wouldn't 
    you go and suck some @$(&amp;!@$)^*!!!), threats of physical violence (e.g. 
    You are about to enter a world of pain, you son of a bitch!! I'm gonna kick 
    your head until it falls off and starts bouncing and rolling down the stairs!!) 
    and capital letters (E.G. FUCK OFF, YOU STUPID BITCH!! GO GET A HUMAN FACE 
    OR SOMETHING INSTEAD OF THE HIDEOUS-LOOKING ONE YOU HAVE!!).</p>
  <p align="left">WHAT ARE F... Sorry, forgot to turn off the caps lock button. 
    What are flame wars?</p>
  <p align="left">Flame wars occur when two or more different parties engage in 
    a violent argument that, in a certain stage, turns into what is called a &quot;flame 
    war&quot;. A flame war would continue until one of the parties would withdraw 
    and admit that they were wrong, if the flame war is killed by the moderator 
    of the discussion mailing list, message board, IRC channel etc' or if one 
    of the parties gets tired and stops responding to the other party's flames.</p>
  <p align="left">When and why can/would I get flamed?</p>
  <p align="left">You can and probably will get flamed when you ask a number of 
    questions or post a number of comments. I've sorted these into several groups 
    and given examples for each group.</p>

    most chances are that noone would help you, unless it's a special help board

  <p align="left"><b><font size="4">How to avoid getting flamed</font></b><br>
    ---------------------------<br>
    a) DO NOT make any of the mistakes and flame-starting actions listed above.<br>
    b) Think twice before doing anything.<br>
    c) Make sure you knwo what you're talking about.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>What to do after you've been flamed</b><br>
    -----------------------------------<br>
    In most cases, it's better to leave the flamer alone and quiet-down the issue. 
    In some cases, you might have to reply, in which case you must find a way 
    out. While you do so, try not to flame anyone back and make sure you don't 
    give too many reasons for why you did this and that or said this and that, 
    and only give REEEEAL GOOD reasons.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Flaming-related concepts</b><br>
    ------------------------<br>
    * /dev/null - if you don't know what this is, you probably never studied Unix 
    very thoroughly. Everything sent to /dev/null disappears from existence. This 
    feature is very useful in many situations. For example: if you want to run 
    and kill all the output and direct possible errors to /usr/share/logs/log.txt, 
    you can type this: command &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;/usr/share/logs/log.txt</p>
  <p align="left">command &gt; /dev/null or command &gt; 1&gt;/dev/null will direct 
    all output (stdout - Standard Output) to /dev/null. command 0&gt;/dev/null 
    will direct all input (stdin - Standard Input) to the command to /dev/null. 
    command 2/dev/null will direct all errors (stderr - Standard Errors) to /dev/null.</p>
  <p align="left">When someone tells you to direct your flames to /dev/null, he 
    means that you'd better shut up.</p>
  <p align="left">* STFU - Shut The Fuck Up.</p>
  <p align="left">* FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions. A file that contains... 
    you've guessed it!<br>
    Frequently Asked Questions.</p>
  <p align="left">* RTFF - Read The Fucking FAQ / Read The Fine FAQ.</p>
