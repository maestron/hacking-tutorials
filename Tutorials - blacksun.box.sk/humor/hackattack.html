girl Sandy_389<br>

You know I cant discuss the contents of this<br>

My OG"s, GR, AZTEK and DF were awaiting an 0-day<br>

All of a sudden the rest of the crew logged in.<br>

They had left the channel to smoke some pot and drink some Gin.<br>

From Spider to Matt both pimpin from front to back,<br>
