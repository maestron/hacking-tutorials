  So you want to upgrade your CD-ROM drive or put in a cd burner without having 
  to pay $50 to install it? or just want to install it on a machine that does 
  not have one? Well you came to the right place. In this tutorial I will provide 
  you with information on installing a new CD-ROM drive. And for more hardware 
  installation guides visit <a href="%20http://blacksun.box.sk" target="_blank">Blacksun 
  Research Facility</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="1"></a>I.Supplies needed and costs</b></font><br>
  <br>
  Supplies you need will be:
<ul>
  <li>A CD-ROM drive ($40-$300 depending on if its a Burner or DVD)</li>
  <li>Phillips Screwdriver (Should have)</li>
  <li>Needlenose Pliers (Should have)</li>
  <li>Anti-static wrist strap(optional)<br>
  </li>
</ul>

  Before you start digging around in your computer...you are going to want to 
  get everything you need at hand. Clear a space on a desk or table and unplug 
  your computer and carry the case where it is well lighted. Remove the screws 
  holding the out shell of your case, and remove out shell. Now you should be 
  able to see the motherboard and all the insides. So you know, the box in the 
  top left with red, yellow, and black cables coming out is the power supply. 
  At the end of those wires is a connecter with 4 pin holes. Then the ribbons 
  you see are what transfer the data from the drive to the motherboard. Look at 
  your existing setup and look how they connect to the floppy drive etc.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="3"></a>III.The Installation of the CD-ROM drive (Section 
  A, Section B)</b></font><br>
  <br>
  Follow the following sections on what tasks you want to accomplish.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Section A: If you are adding a CD-ROM drive(Burner,DVD, or any CD-ROM)</li>
  <li>Section B: If you are upgrading a existing CD-ROM </li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="3a"></a>Section A:Adding a CD-ROM drive(Burner,DVD, or any CD-ROM)</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> Remove the face plate cover on your tower where your CD-ROM will be taking 
    its place.</li>
  <li> Set the jumper on the back of your new CD_ROM drive to slave if not already 
    set. If there is no diagram refer to manufacturers website for settings.</li>
  <li> Slide the drive in to the open slot in your case. But do not screw in the 
    screws yet because you might need to slide it around.</li>
  <li>Once your drive is in place look at the IDE ribbon connected to your hard 
    drive and see if there are any free connectors to plug in to your CD-ROM. 
    If there are not use the IDE ribbon that came with the drive and connect it 
    to the CD-ROM (Note:That ribbon is how your CD-ROM drive communicates with 
    your Motherboard.</li>
  <li>Connect the audio cable(small cable almost like phone cord and jack) to 
    your CD-ROM drive then connect the other to your Audio card. If you cantfind 
    your audio card look for a small black jack which would fit the connector.(Note:This 
    is only nessary if you want sound from your CD-ROM.</li>
  <li> Now its time to connect your power supply connector to your CD-ROM drive. 
    It is a cord that has yellow black and red wires with a connector on the end.</li>
  <li>Once everything is connected, screw the drive into place and close up the 
    case and reboot. If your running Windows 98 it should recognize it right away.</li>
  <li>Test it out to make sure its working. Install Drivers for the CD-ROM if 
    any came with it.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p> <br>
  <b><a name="3b"></a>Section B:Upgrading a existing CD-ROM</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> Remove the existing hard drive by disconnecting all the cables and power 
    supply.</li>
  <li> Set the jumper on the back of your new CD_ROM drive to the same settings 
    on your old CD-ROM drive.</li>
  <li> Slide the drive in to the open slot in your case. But do not screw in the 
    screws yet because you might need to slide it around.</li>
  <li> Once your drive is in place look at the IDE ribbon connected to your hard 
    drive and see if there are any free connectors to plug in to your CD-ROM. 
    If there are not use the IDE ribbon that came with the drive and connect it

  Now you will be saving money by installing hardware by yourself without having 
  to pay $60 a hour labor cost at a computing store. As you learn more about computers 
  you will soon realize that you will save lots of money on repairs if you can 
  do them yourself. So I hope you enjoyed this and I hope it was helpful. Feel
