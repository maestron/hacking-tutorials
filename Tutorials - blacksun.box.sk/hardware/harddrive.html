  Supplies you need will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Hard drive ($50-$250 depending on size)</li>
  <li>Phillips Screwdriver (Should have)</li>
  <li>Needlenose Pliers (Should have)</li>

  Before you start digging around in your computer...you are going to want to 
  get everything you need at hand. If you are starting clean and reinstalling 
  a new version of windows you will want to have a formatted drive and a DOS boot 
  disk. You can create a boot disk by getting a blank floppy and open My Computer 
  then right click on (A:) and select format. Then select option &quot;Copy System 
  files&quot; which then will create a disk for booting up in DOS prompt once 
  you have fomatted your hard drive for Windows installation. If you have a existing 
  drive that you want transfer your data to your new hard drive, you will want 
  to get a DiskCopy utility from (www.powerquest.com). Also note that DISKCOPY 
  and XCOPY will not copy hidden and system files. Once you have all disk backed 
  up and ready to move, clear a space on a desk or table and unplug your computer 
  and carry the case where it is well lighted. Remove the screws holding the out 
  shell of your case, and remove out shell. Now you should be able to see the 
  motherboard and all the insides. So you know, the box in the top left with red, 
  yellow, and black cables coming out is the power supply. At the end of those 
  wires is a connecter with 4 pin holes. Then the ribbons you see are what transfer 
  the data from the drive to the motherboard. Look at your existing setup and 
  look how they connect to the floppy drive etc.<br>

  Ok. Now your ready to install the hard drive. If your replacing a existing drive 
  look at the jumper settings on the back of your hard drive. Jumpers are what 
  tell your computer what its purpose is. They are pins in sets of 2. They look 
  like this :::[:]:: with ( :=pins and []=the jumper which slids on the pins. 
  ) Once you find out what your existing drive's jumper settings are you then 
  can set your new hard drives jumper settings to the same as the existing. Most 
  drives have listed what the settings are but if they are not listed on the actual 
  hard drive you should refer to the manufacturers website. Your new hard drive 
  should be set on Master and if your just adding an additional hard drive set 
  your old one to slave and new one to master. Now when putting in your new drive 
  you are going to want to slide it in ussually below floppy drive or anywhere 
  you have room. Once you have it slid in connect the power connector to the drive 
  and the wide EIDE ribbon with the pink line on the right near the power connector. 
  Once installation is complete of your hard drive, re-connect the cables and 
  moniter and turn on the power.<br>

  <br>
  On boot enter your PC's setup program(On boot it ussually shows you what key 
  to press for system setup) and check the BIOS for drives 1 and 2 if you added 
  an additional hard drive. Make sure both drives are set on AUTO so it can detect 
  and set up correctly. Save and reboot.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  Once windows is booted up check out the new drive and make sure it is working 
  properly. If you added a drive reformat the old one so now you can prepare it 
  for more data. I hope this helped you in the steps of installing or upgrading 
  a new hard drive. If you have any suggestions or questions feel free to email 
  me. More tutorials to come and soon a HTML version with picture references.<br>
