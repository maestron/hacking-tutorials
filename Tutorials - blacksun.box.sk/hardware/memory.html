  Is your PC running slow? Well memory upgrades are about the cheapest upgrade 
  that you can do to improve your computers performance drastically. This will 
  be a easy tutorial to understand so you can pop in your memory and determine 
  from now<br>
  on out what you have inside your computer. This will be a step by step guide 
  to install Simms and Dimm memmory. Simms memory slots are small and a whiteish 
  color. Dimm memory slots are longer in length and are black. So please when 
  following this tutorial please do not skip read, read carefully or it could 
  end up costing you money. So enjoy this tutorial from Blacksun.box.sk. And for 
  more hardware installation guides visit <a href="http://blacksun.box.sk" target="_blank">Blacksun 
  Research Facility</a>.<br>

  <br>
  Supplies you need will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Memory ($50(32MB)-$200(128MB)) - <a href="http://www.kingston.com" target="_blank">www.kingston.com</a> 
    - <a href="http://www.crucial.com" target="_blank">www.crucial.com</a></li>
  <li>Phillips Screwdriver (Should have)</li>
  <li>Anti-static wrist strap(optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="2"></a>II.Steps before installation and preparation</b></font><br>
  <br>
  Before we start getting into the installation you should have already looked 
  inside your computer for what type of memory your computer support. If you have 
  2 or more white slots open means you need 72 pin SIMMS memory. SIMMS must be 
  put<br>
  in pairs. DIMM on the other hand can go in by itself, so it doesnt need a pair. 
  Clear a space on a desk or table and unplug your computer and carry the case 
  where it is well lighted. Remove the screws holding the out shell of your case, 
  and remove out shell. Now you should be able to see the motherboard and all 
  the insides. Now look for your memory slots on your mother board, If you can 
  not see them then you might have to move or take some stuff out to be able to 
  move around inside but you probly wont have to. So you know, the box in the 
  top left with red, yellow, and black cables coming out is the power supply.<br>
  <br>
  <b><font size="4"><a name="3"></a>III.The Installation of the Memory</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Ok. Now your ready to install the memory.</p>
<p><b>If you are installing SIMMs memory then...</b><br>
  Grab one of the sticks of memory and slide it into slot from the top at a 60 
  degree angle(Ex.\.). Once you have it slid all the way in,push it to a upright 
  position until you hear it click. Now put in its pair. Then re-connect the cables 
  and moniter and turn on the power. On the boot up screen look at the memory 
  count will be like 32838k(32MB) of memory. Make sure its reading the memory. 
  If that number varies significantly from what you were expecting contact manufacturer 
  or dealer you bought your memory from.</p>
<p> <b>If you are installing DIMM memory then...</b><br>
  Grab one of the sticks of DIMM memory and line it up to the DIMM Socket so the 
  grooves in the memory stick are the same on the motherboard. Once lined up push 
  the white arms on the top and bottom of the DIMM socket to a outward position 
  so they are not in the way of the memory. Now press firmly on the top and bottom 
  until the white arms come in locking the memory in place.Then re-connect the 
  cables and moniter and turn on the power. On the boot up screen look at the 
  memory count will be like 32838k(32MB) of memory. Make sure its reading the 
  memory. If that number varies significantly from what you were expecting contact 
  manufacturer or dealer you bought your memory from.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="4"></a>IV.CMOS Check</b></font><br>
  <br>
  On boot enter your PC should recognize the memory. Not many systems require 
  you but if its required you will get a error message. Then enter your systems 
  setup.<br>
  <br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="5"></a>V.Conclusion</b></font><br>
  <br>
  Once windows is booted up check out the new memory and make sure it is working 
  properly. I hope this helped you in the steps of installing or upgrading your 
  new memory. If you have any suggestions or questions feel free to <a href="mailto:Cadtrick@hotmail.com">email
