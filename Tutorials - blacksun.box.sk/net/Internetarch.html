an elite hacker or a cracker, but will clear up many misunderstandings you might 
have about the Internet and the way it is structured. Okay before you start 
reading, i will be summarizing most of this info because many other tutorials 
have been written in detail explaining the sections presented. This is just 
another way to say, IAM NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME TYPING. So i see you have 
downloaded this text to learn more about the wonderful tool the world has ever 
seen, but do you really understand the juicy info behind the Internet? Well 
after reading this you will!<BR><BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff><B><A 
name=summary></A>1: Summary on the history of the Internet (boring yet 
vital)<BR></B></FONT><B></B><BR><BR>Well every place i go i keep hearing ppl 
saying things like i was chatting, or i sent him/her an email, or i was checking 
his site on the INTERNET. Now when you are asked what is the Internet? you 
reply, Well the Internet is like a program i write a www.blahblah.com and i see 
stuff and i download it, not hard, probably took days to do, well someone is 
wrong, heheheh.<BR><BR>The Internet is a global assemblage of more than 20 
million computers and growing in rapid intercommunication. These forms of 
communication links are made up of optical fibers, digital cables, satellite 
transmissions, and yup you guessed it, telephone lines. The Internet can be 
described in three terms, the hardware infrastructure that supports it, the 
software that powers it, and the people who populate it. <BR><BR>When the 
Internet began, until the early 90s, the only guys who used it weren't normal 
ppl, but they were the scientists, academics, science students and the real deal 
computer programmers who were pursuing long-distance collaborations and 
research. The Internet isn't something that just popped out of nowhere, it has 
been around for decades, but was something overlooked by the media until 1990. 
Well the origin of the Internet dates back to 1970, when four computers, yes 
four, one each at The University of California at Los Angeles, The University of 
California at Santa Barbara, The Stanford Research Institute, and The University 
of Utah at Salt Lake City were hooked up over phone lines. <BR><BR>From the 
first four computers that powered the first Internet, 13 years later 562 boxes 
were connected to it in 1983, and by 1993 that number has reached 1.2 million 
and in 1996 it was 12 million, and this number remains doubling every 12-14 
months. One critical component underlying today's Internet is the software that 
supports network communications. In the Internets's beginning dayz, the software 
that powered the networks wasn't user friendly, they didn't have fancy crap with 
popup menus and fancy Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), they had cryptic programs 
which looked like hell for normal people. One reason for this is because the 
only people who used the net were scientists who didn't care about user friendly 
interfaces. The software they designed was difficult, which hindered the 
popularity of the net. <BR><BR>The first tools that these cool guys made that 
innovated the Internet were, Telnet, yup the good old telnet, which was made in 
1969 and second, the File Transfer Protocol (ftp), which was made in 1971 and is 
still in great use today. (i wasn't born yet, heh) Other popular communication 
programs have also evolved with the Internet, which are know by the names of: 
Usenet Newsgroups, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Gophers, and Multi-user Dungeons 
(MUD's).<BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ffffff><A name=jargon></A>2: Internet 
Protocols and Jargon (what those 3 letter words mean)</FONT></B> <BR><BR><BR>We 
computer guys tend to speak in acronyms, small words that have a lot of valuable 
info. Acronyms are ubiquitous on the Internet, and all this wonder will be 
explained here. <BR><BR>Many Internet acronyms involve a "P" letter. Lets look 
at these, we have, SLIP, TCP, UDP, FTP, ICMP, SMTP, HTTP, PPP, IP, and Mikkkeee 
(only playing). Okay now you have witnessed the confusion, what does all this 
stuff mean. All of them stand for the word "protocol." So when ever you see a 
"P" at the end of a computer acronym, there is a big chance its stands for 
protocol. Now the tough part is what is this protocol? Well a protocol in 
computer science just refers to formalities and conventions observed by 
computers during cross computer communication. So its just like this, in order 
for boxes to share data, each box must use the same data transfer rules, or we 
won't have communication. Just like the old dayz when ppl used the telegraph, 
which communicated through the communication protocol called the Morse code. 
Then came the Ham radio operators who also had their protocols and now we have 
the Internet, which also needs its little protocols. <BR><BR>(Now I am not going 
to kill you via boredom by explain the concept of protocols because they are 
already explained by the tutorials found at BSRF, but i will sprinkle the 
sprinkles on the cake.) <BR><BR>The Internet Protocol (IP) is the cornerstone 
for all Internet communications. In fact, you can see if a box is alive (on the 
net) by asking for its IP, yah not going far as to doing something lame as 
DoSing the box! Now each computer on the Internet has a unique IP number that 
operates as its Internet address. When we say that there are 20 million 
computers on the Internet, that figure is really based on the number of IP 
addresses in use in that year. <BR><BR>As you have begun to browser the net, or 
start your mission in becoming a hacker, you will most likely come across some 
reference to the Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol(TCP/IP). TCP is 
nothing to be feared, it works closely with IP in order to prepare packets of 
data before an Internet data transfer. TCP also interprets those same packets at 
the receiving end after the transfer. <BR><BR>Additional protocols are also used 
to power the net. These are, the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which moves filz 
from one computer to another. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) designed 
in 1982 to support e-mail communications. The HyperText Transfer Protocol 
(HTTP), made in 1990 so that web browsers could read documents on the 
web.<BR><BR>The Point-to-point protocol (PPP) and the Serial Line Internet 
Protocol (SLIP), which generally are terms used if you need to set up access to 
the Internet over a telephone line through an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
These protocols are used when a computer wants to communicate over the Internet, 
over a serial transmission line, like an analog telephone line, and the user 
wants to use a browser such as Internet Explorer. So his isp will offer a ppp or 
a slip account to the users who want to view graphics on the net. (Now you might 
have noticed that I didn't go in depth but for further information on protocols 
check out the tuts at bsrf for further info.) <BR><BR><BR><B><FONT 
color=#ffffff><A name=host></A>3: Host Machines and Host 
Names<BR></FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT><BR><BR>Now to gain good 
knowledge on how the net works you will need to know something about host 
machines/host names. <BR><BR>Now a computer that has been assigned an IP address 
is called a HOST MACHINE. Each IP address is made up of four integers separated 
by periods. Lets take an example, my ip on the net yesterday was 150.211.39.128 
just like zip codes tell a person where you live, IP addresses reveal not your 
geographical info, but your computer network's info. Now the numbers to the 
furthermost part to the left represent the large part of the Internet, while the 
numbers to the further part of the right represent a specific host machine. 
<BR><BR>While all these numbers are fine for computer communications, long 
strings of numbers are not easy for us to remember so that's why we have 
substituted the long strings of numbers into symbolic names. Symbolic names look 
like this www.yahoo.com, which is easier to remember. Symbolic host names are 
always converted into their IP addresses for the purpose of network 
communications. The Domain Name Service (DNS) is responsible for this task of 
mapping symbolic names to their numerical equivalents, and symbolic host names 
are often called DNS names or addresses. Lets look at an example, DNS names, 
follow certain naming conventions that help us remember the names easily. so we 
have <BR><BR></FONT></P><PRE><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>

<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>ohh one more thing, 
sometimes lamers talk about "HIGH LEVEL DOMAIN NAMES" so they think they are so 
smart well they are only referring to the final part of the full domain name. 
This means a high level domain name identifies the type of site and where the 
host machine resides. Here is a 
list:<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------------------------<BR>.com = a 
commercial organization<BR>.edu = an educational site<BR>.org = a nonprofit 
organization <BR>.net = a network site<BR>.gov = a government agency<BR>.mil = a 
military site <BR><BR>These high level domain names can in many cases be 
followed by other suffixes, that will identify their geographical location by 
country. This list is very small, (ahh again a complete list can be found at 
BSRF) blahblah.net.lk = Sri Lanka blahblah.net.il = Isreal blahblah.net.gb =

color=#ffffff><A name=packet></A>4: Architecture of the Internet and Packet 
Switching <BR></FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT><BR><BR>Well while you 
browse the Internet you might think every computer on it is equal well your 
wrong, not all computers are equal. Well to understand what i mean i have to 
explain to you how data gets moved across the Internet by PACKET 
SWITCHING.<BR><BR>In order to understand packet switching you will have to 
understand what packet switching tries to achieve. When the Department of 
Defense was paying for the original network research that led to the Internet, 
they wanted a strong network that could withstand regional power blackouts or 
other problems. So in order to achieve such a robust communication, it was vital 
to design a transmission protocol that could readily find new routes if its 
destination was dead for some reason. So those guys came up with a cool plan to 
design a form of DYNAMIC ROUTING, which will become the standard means of moving 
data across the network. Dynamic Routing just means that routes for data are 
always selected at the time of transmission, after taking current network 
conditions into consideration. <BR><BR>The network designers also felt it was 
important to distribute route-selection capabilities throughout the network, so 
that no single site was responsible for the entire network. Let me explain this 
further, lets say like a network was designed " hierarchically " so that 
everything passes through that central routing site, so if anything happens to 
that central routing site well HOUSTON WE GOT A PROBLEM! <BR><BR></FONT></P><PRE><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>This is how a hierarchically network would look like:

                        O O O  O    so if anything happens to the big <BR>                                          box then we got a big problem.

</PRE>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>So since these guys 
were very smart they built the Internet in "heterarchically," which really means 
instead of having one central routing site, there are a large number of routing 
sites distributed all over the network. The hosts that decide how to route 
transmissions across the Internet are called ROUTERS. The Internet today is 
currently being run by thousands of these hosts called routers.

<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>So now you figured 
out the difference, dynamic heterarchical routing is what makes the Internet 
work so good, and the key idea that binds everything together is packet 
switching. All of the data moved across the Internet is moved in units called 
PACKETS. The traffic on the net is measured by counting the packets transferred 
in a period of time. <BR><BR>If this concept is hard for you to understand let 
me explain. Lets say you are downloading a file from a server in California to 
your box in New York. The software running on the server breaks the huge file 
into packets. Lets say your file was 100k it might be broken down info 6 or 7 
packets, then each packet is stamped with the IP address of its destination, as 
well as the IP address of the originating host. Packets will also be given 
instructions, these instructions describe the size of the original transmission 
and where each specific packet should be positioned when the original 
transmission is put together when it gets to my computer. Now the big deal is 
that each packet is sent out onto the Internet to find its way to the 
destination address. This means that the 6 or 7 packets don't have to travel 
together so they can go from California to other parts of the country then they 
find their way to New York. The packets are first given to a router, which looks 
at their destination address and decides where to send the packets. Now the 
router at that location then does the same thing. So when all the packets come 
to New York, they are then assembled into a single file. Each packet is checked 
first to see if it has arrived intact. If there was an error in a packet then a 
request to resend that packet is sent to the originating host. This form of 
sending files is the best way to work on a net, because it minimizes network 
load and by sending small packets the destination won't have to wait for the 
whole file to be sent if it had errors. Every computer running on the Internet 
uses this form of data transfer. <BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ffffff>Important 
newbie fact <BR></FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT><BR><BR>Well if your 
reading this you probably were alive in 1996, well what's the big deal you ask, 
lets put this concept of packet switching into the real world. On August 7, 
1996, 6 million AOL customers were unable to access the Internet because AOL had 
recently loaded new software onto its network routers. This software contained 
incorrect routing information. As a result, AOL couldn't route packets on or off 
its gateway hosts. The 6 million guys waiting soon found out that their aol 
service was interrupted and for 19 hours these guys couldn't surf the net. Now 
since only AOL had this problem, the rest of the world who are smart enough not 
to use aol were checking their email and chatting and visiting sites, thanks to 
the architecture of the net not all of us suffered. <BR><BR><BR><B><FONT 
color=#ffffff><A name=band></A>5: Bandwith and Asynchronous Communication 
<BR></FONT></B><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT><BR><BR>Okay, you're probably saying 
what's this topic Mike? Its nothing to fear, i'll explain in simple English a 
little child can understand. <BR><BR>Online communication takes some time for 
normal people to understand or to just get used to. In the world you live in 
called off-line world communication is dominated by two way, real time 
communication, ie. you and a friend talking. This conversation is being operated 
in two directions, with questions/answers being talked about right away. Now in 
the computer sphere, a two way communication mediated by shared signals for 
beginning/ending conversations is called SYNCHRONOUS communication. Synchronous 
communication is like normal human/animal conversation. This form of 
communication relies on shared signals for starting and stopping. Examples of 
this communication would be like your browser sending a msg to a host and the 
host sends you something, a packet or a file. Programs which deal with this 
communication are software found on your box, Cu-Cms and RealVideo are some, 
which allow internet users with properly equipped hosts to converse with other 
internet users through a video channel. Problems arise in this form of 
communication, because as both of us know if you don't have the bandwidth, you 
will be staring at a video box with images that are jerky and stroboscopic 
(images which look like garbage). <BR><BR>When a communication exchange does not 
rely on shared signals for starting and stopping, this communication is called 
ASYNCHRONOUS communication. Now your probably confused but don't be. This form 
of communication seen online is characterized by long waits for responses. This 
communication is seen in email messages which take some people forever to answer 
back. This doesn't have anything to do with the servers or the bandwidth, but 
has to do with the human being on the other side. Email messages are delivered 
in a matter of seconds, but there is no guarantee that an intended recipient 
will be ready and waiting to reply as soon as your message is received. So the 
reason for this is that it pays to think about what your are saying and how your 
saying because it will affect the outcome of the asynchronous communication. 
<BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ffffff><A name=charge></A>6: Who is in 
Charge?</FONT></B><BR><BR><BR>Your probably wondering, yeah I always wanted an 
answer to that question, so explain to me plz. hehe! <BR><BR>Okay I am not going 
to lie to you, questions about Internet management and maintenance are very 
boring so bare with me. You might also want to ask who pays for all this? Who 
fixes it when it messes up? Who is responsible for keeping everything working? 
Who makes the decisions about the future of this wonderful tool? Well I'll 
answer everything right here. <BR><BR>As I explained in the previous parts of 
this text, the net is composed of thousands of smaller networks that are 
independent from one another, remember the heterarchical structure,heh. Now 
these smaller networks are managed by corporations, government agencies and 
universities with different hardware platforms and different network 
technologies. Now you see that I am going back and all these small and large 
networks are held together by a wonderful glue called TCP/IP. But I see your 
going to ask, okay, cool but what holds it together administratively, like how 
can this huge tool have no central authority? Okay let me answer your question, 
remember when i told you that the Internet was made by scientists and 
programmers, well those guys have always pushed the spirit of this wonderful 
tool. So when these guys made up TCP/IP they made it public so that TCP/IP could 
be placed on any hardware platform. Now the Department of Defense had a large 
part in this deal but like the Department of Defense, the university researchers 
also did a lot, and like the rest they also made their finding public. By doing 
this anyone who had access to the internet, could access these documents and put 
their own influence into the development of the net. Now you might think that 
all this public stuff is done with, well not. This way of life is still managed 
by a group that oversees the continuing growth of the Internet, this group is 
called, INTERNET SOCIETY (ISOC). This organization oversees a number of smaller 
groups also pursuing the growth of the net. These groups are: <BR><BR><B>- 
Disaster Assistance Committee <BR>- Internet Operations Forum <BR>- Internet 
Architecture Board (IAB) <BR>- Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) <BR>- 
Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) <BR>- Internet Engineering Steering 
Group (IESG) <BR>- Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) <BR>- k-12 Committee 
<BR></B><FONT color=#ffffff></FONT><BR>ISOC has no sanction or governmental 
power so it operates as a resource for ppl who want to participate in the growth 
of the net. <BR><BR>The Internet's high-speed backbone is a key component of the 
net, and many different organizations have said they are responsible for 
maintaining the backbone. In the 70's, research parties funded by the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) were given access to ARPAnet. In the late 70's, 
the National Science Foundation (NSF) joined with ARPA to create a network that 
would be more available for computer scientists in the US. NSF then gave birth 
to CSnet in 1979. In 1982, a gateway was established between ARPAnet/CSnet, 
which demonstrated the viability of a network of networks like a small version 
of the Internet. After the joining of ARPAnet/CSnet, the term "INTERNET" was 
then adopted. <BR><BR>By 1983, more networks began to do the same thing by 
expanding/establishing their own user communities. In San Francisco, FidoNet 
connected FidoBBS (Bulletin Board Systems) across the nation so that many users 
of local bulletin boards could exchange messages by email/discussion groups. In 
the same year, the Department of Defense switched all of its military networks 
to the TCP/IP protocol. By then, TCP/IP software was only included in all UNIX 
software distros out of the University of California at Berkley. UNIX was the 
operating system of choice for computer scientist, and it still is, so by doing 
this a huge jump was put in Internet expansion. <BR><BR>BY 1985 the Internet was 
further expanded when NSF became a leader in network communication and they got 
funding from Congress to join 100 more universities to the Internet. By doing 
this NSF then connected five supercomputer sites in a new network called NSFnet. 
With all these costs and further spending the Federal Government, soon realized 
it couldn't afford to subsidize the Internet. So now it became a private 
industry. So the firms which made up the NSFnet backbone (IBM, MCI, MERIT) 
created a nonprofit company called Advanced Networks and Services (ANS). Then in 
1992, ANS built a new backbone, ANSnet, with 30 times the bandwidth of the old 
NSFnet backbone. ANSnet is the current backbone for the Internet and the first 
one not maintained by the government but by private companies. <BR><BR>Now since 
your probably bored and confused, let me finish off, since no federally 
sponsored organization oversees everything, there are some which monitor some 
parts. Lets look at Federal Communication Commission (FCC) they don't have any 
authority over the net, but they do regulate the billing practices of telephone 
companies. This is really cool, cause the FCC does not allow phone companies to 
bill ppl for digital communication differently than they do for voice 
communication. So the main deal is this, the net is operated by small spheres 
and ppl who impose on themselves to censor stuff or to protect ppl from the bad 
sides of the net. <BR><BR><BR><B><FONT color=#ffffff><A name=future></A>7: The
