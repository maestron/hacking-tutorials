This sole purpose of the information contained in this advisory is to point out 
the flaws in InterNIC's domain name handling system and is intented for education. 
Any abuse of the information in whole or in part is NOT my responsibility nor

  <br>

</p>
<ul>
  <li> anonymous remailer or mail bomber which could spoof email adresses (I used

  As an example for this advisory, I will take the domain name wi2000.org. Go 
  to <a href="http://networksolutions.com" target="_blank">networksolutions.com</a> 
  and click on the link that says 'Who Is.' Now enter the domain name (wi2000.org 
  in this case) in the search field and click on the 'Search' button. This would

<p>Now you have two choices here:</p>
<p><b>-01&gt;</b> Either you could take full control of the domain by changing 
  the Administrator's handle information.</p>
<p> OR</p>
<p><b>-02&gt;</b> You could simply point the domain to another host and let it 
  recover in time by itself.</p>
<p>The first approach is very aggressive and could be hazardous if you are going 
  for gov or mil domain names so I recommend second approach for gov and mil domains.<br>
  <b><font size="4"><br>
  Intiating the First Attack:</font></b><br>
  <br>
  Let me first explain the InterNIC authentication system in case most of you 
  would be the readers who do not have their own domain names. The problem with 
  InterNIC authentication is that they do NOT send a confirmation email if the 
  request is sent from the same email as the person owning the contact or the 
  domain name itself! Therefore, utilizing this flaw one could spoof anyone's 
  email address and change any domain name's information. Although, a confirmation 
  is required from the person to whom the domain is about to be transferred; and 
  that shouldn't be too hard as it would your own email address ;-)</p>
<p>Here's a step by step procedure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/" target="_blank">http://www.networksolutions.com/</a></li>
  <li>Click on the link that says 'Make Changes.'</li>
  <li>Enter the domain name wi2000.org</li>
  <li>You should be presented with 2 blue buttons</li>
  <li>Click on the one that says *Expert*</li>
  <li>Next screen would have a heading 'Select the form that meets your needs'</li>
  <li>Click on the link that say 'Contact Form'</li>
  <li>Next you should see a form with 2 fields.</li>
  <li>In the first field enter the admin's handle (wi2000.org admin is AMM367)</li>
  <li>In the next field enter his/her email address (in this case it's HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM)</li>
  <li>Change the option to 'Modify.'</li>
  <li>Now 'Proceed to Contact Information.'</li>
  <li>Select the MAIL-FROM option and click the 'Go on to Contact Data Information.'</li>
  <li>Now you should see all the information about the admin contact of domain 
    name!</li>
  <li>In the E-mail address field change the email to your own fake email. (I 
    changed it to dd@doom.com)</li>
  <li>Now 'Proceed to Set Authorization Scheme.'</li>
  <li>Again choose MAIL-FROM and enter the email address of the admin (HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM)</li>
  <li>Leave the bottom option to 'No' and 'Generate Contact Form.'</li>
  <li>Now you should see a template with all the information. Similar to this:</li>

  You should now be thinking that this message could get you in trouble but there 
  is a way of getting rid of this trouble. Here you'll use your mailbomber to 
  mailbomb the guy with 20-30 similar messages if you want your attack to be successful. 
  The person would see 35 messages from the same address and therefore would delete 
  all of them and you'd probably be safe. If he 'would' email someone then he 
  would probably reply to the wrong tracking number. In the above case, the tracking 
  number is [NIC-000128.4r50]. OK, here another hard part. You have to open your 
  notepad and generate similar numbers actually come up with them. You should 
  NEVER mailbomb the person with the same tracking number. What I mean is that 
  you should never send more than one emails to him from [NIC-000128.4r50] in 
  the next email, change the [NIC-000128.4r50] to [NIC-000127.5089] or something 
  different. Here is a list of some numbers that I generated just to give you 
  a good idea of how the scheme works.</p>
<p>[NIC-000127.5089]<br>
  [NIC-000128.4rg7]<br>
  [NIC-000128.523f]<br>

<p>Stop after you have mailed him/her 10-15 messages! Now it's time to email hostmaster@networksolutions.com

  one emails!! That's pretty much it. Now continue to bomb HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM, 
  changing the tracking number everytime until your 30-35 tracking numbers are 
  used up!</p>
<p>Now all you gotta do it WAIT. After 24 hours you could go and change the domain

  NOTE: This attack will only work on domains that have an admin contact different<br>

  ____________________________<br>
  Intiating the Second Attack:<br>
  ----------------------------<br>
  This attack will be successful even if the technical and admin contact are the<br>
  same but the admin of the contact needs to be kind of stupid to disregard<br>
  emails from interNIC as he is also the technical contact; but this method should<br>
  work as it has worked for me.<br>
  The procedure is basically the same apart from the fact that this time:<br>
  - Go to http://www.networksolutions.com/<br>
  - Click on the link that says 'Make Changes.'<br>
  - Enter the domain name wi2000.org<br>
  - You should be presented with 2 blue buttons<br>
  - Click on the one that says *Expert*<br>
  - Next screen would have a heading 'Select the form that meets your needs'<br>
  - Click on the link that say 'Service Agreement.'<br>
  - Now when it asks for email address, enter your own.<br>
  - Now you should see many fields, don't panic!<br>
  - Go to the technical contact and change the handle to freeservers, hypermart 
  e.t.c.<br>
  - Now come to 'Nameserver Information.'<br>
  - Change the nameservers to hypermart or freeserver nameservers.<br>
  - If there's anything in the 'Optional Information' after that then <br>
  simply delete them.<br>
  - Click on the button 'Submit this form for processing.'<br>
  - You are done, the form will be emailed to your email address.<br>
  - When the form arrives in your email, then simply take this part:<br>

  ____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> - Now launch your anonymous remailer or mailbomber.<br>
  - From: the domain admin (HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM in this case).<br>
  - To: hostmaster@networksolutions.com<br>
  - Subject: (do not enter any subject, leave the field blank!)<br>
  - Body: the template you created above.<br>
  - You are ready to go but before you send this email to InterNIC,<br>
  remember to bomb HACKEDINDUSTRIES@HOTMAIL.COM with similar emails<br>
  but different tracking numbers as we did in the first procedure.<br>
  - After sending 10-20 emails, send the above template to InterNIC.<br>
  - Continue bombing your 40 messages. Remember to generate 40-50<br>
  tracking numbers.<br>
  - This is basically it.<br>
  - The domain would be transferred to freeservers or hypermart<br>
  and then you could simply activate it from there on your own email<br>
  address. Remember to use a fake email.<br>

<p>_______________<br>
  Possible Fixes:<br>
  ---------------<br>
  As you have seen, InterNIC does not use the tracking number system too<br>
  efficiently. Possible fixes would certainly be a confirmation email to<br>
  the admin contact 'with' a tracking number. NOT the email saying 'Your request 
  <br>
  is being processed' but a confirmation email which would ask, 'Do you agree 
  <br>
  with this request?' even if it has been sent from the same email address as 
  admin's!<br>
  Tracking numbers could be easily generated and the attacks I have mentioned<br>
  above aren't too hard for a script kiddie with a canned bomber.</p>
