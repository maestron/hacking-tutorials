<p>Session Start: Sat Jan 22 18:04:06 2000
<br>[18:04] *** Now talking in #bsrf
<br>[18:04] *** Topic is 'Welcome to #bsrf | Our Website: http://blacksun.box.sk
| Next IRC lecture: 'How Servers are Cracked' | See http://blacksun.box.sk/irc.html
| Alright, I know the bot is down most of the time now, and that the channel
is ultra insecure, so please don't abuse this... heh, yeah right'
<br>[18:04] *** Set by Raven on Wed Jan 19 07:22:58
<br>[18:04] * #bsrf is being logged
<br>[18:04] &lt;INTJ> okie
<br>[18:05] &lt;INTJ> ready?
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> alright
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> is everyone ready?
<br>[18:05] &lt;c0c0> yep
<br>[18:05] &lt;Chaotic_Thought> Yes sir...
<br>[18:05] &lt;Seeker> yup
<br>[18:05] &lt;squiler> yup
<br>[18:05] &lt;INTJ> 9 ppl overall
<br>[18:05] &lt;SnIpEr_WoLf_> yeah
<br>[18:05] &lt;Seeker> that good?
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> including me
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> alright
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> On your marks.
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> Get set.
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> Go!
<br>[18:05] &lt;Raven> okay, so today's topic is...
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> how servers are hacked
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> basically, of course
<br>[18:06] &lt;INTJ> cracked
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> yeah, cracked
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> terminology...
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> hehe
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:06] &lt;INTJ> that's what you wrote on your website ;p
<br>[18:06] &lt;squiler> :)
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> anyway, most of those website defacements...
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> dns cracks
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> email cracks
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> ftp cracks
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> etc' etc'
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> they're usually done in fairly easy and simple ways
<br>[18:06] &lt;Raven> that do not require much knowledge
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> they're usually done by little kids
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> mostly little kids in "hacking" groups
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> who want to show the world how smart they are
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> Phase I
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> --------
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> oops...
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> -------
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> DAMN!
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> lol
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> okay, all over again
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> Phase I
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> -------
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> ahh...
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> that's better
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> any questions so far?
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> okay, so phase one is...
<br>[18:07] &lt;Raven> intelligence gathering
<br>[18:07] &lt;TheJoker> why is it so easy?
<br>[18:08] &lt;Raven> we'll get to that
<br>[18:08] &lt;INTJ> because of ./i-0wn3d-u &lt;server> &lt;port> ;p
<br>[18:08] &lt;Raven> exactly
<br>[18:08] &lt;Raven> if some of u don't understand, don't worry
<br>[18:08] &lt;Raven> we'll get to that
<br>[18:08] &lt;Raven> so anyway, stage one is intelligence gathering
<br>[18:08] &lt;Raven> this is the most important stage
<br>[18:08] &lt;Raven> why?
<br>[18:08] &lt;squiler> ...
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> because otherwise you'll find yourself trying thousands
of sunos 3.4 exploits
<br>[18:09] &lt;Seeker> need to know what os
<br>[18:09] &lt;TheJoker> you have to know what exploits apply
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> while you're actually attacking an nt4.0 server
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> what os...
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> and what is the host running
<br>[18:09] *** c0c0_ has joined #bsrf
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> those are the two most important phases in intelligence
gathering
<br>[18:09] &lt;c0c0_> damn i've disconnected
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> getting them is fairly easy
<br>[18:09] *** c0c0 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<br>[18:09] &lt;INTJ> welcome c0c0_, we're in the middle of the lecture
<br>[18:09] *** c0c0_ is now known as c0c0
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> poor soul
<br>[18:09] &lt;TheJoker> nmap?
<br>[18:09] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> that's two
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> nmap is too "advanced" for most script kiddies
<br>[18:10] &lt;TheJoker> advanced?
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> most people use really amateurish methods
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> such as reading daemon banners
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> (yes, it requires the "cracker" to have unix...
ooh)
<br>[18:10] &lt;TheJoker> hehe
<br>[18:10] &lt;Seeker> whats a daemon banner?
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> and to know how to install new software
<br>[18:10] &lt;squiler> ha
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> alright, i'll show u
<br>[18:10] &lt;squiler> oo me oo me!
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> everyone, do telnet mailgw.netvision.net.il
<br>[18:10] &lt;Raven> this is my isp's smtp server
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> smtp = simple mail transfer protocol
<br>[18:11] &lt;INTJ> but daemon banner is trivial to be spoofed
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> for outgoing mail
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> yes, of course
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> first, let's explain to those who don't know what
daemon banners are
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> what do u get when u telnet to mailgw.netvision.net.il?
<br>[18:11] &lt;Seeker> oh, i think i know what you mean
<br>[18:11] &lt;c0c0> Trying 194.90.1.14...
<br>[18:11] &lt;squiler> "could not connect"
<br>[18:11] &lt;squiler> :-)
<br>[18:11] &lt;c0c0> telnet: connect to address 194.90.1.14: Connection
refused
<br>[18:11] &lt;c0c0> telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection
refused
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> oops
<br>[18:11] *** SnIpEr_WoLf_ has left #bsrf
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> telnet mailgw.netvision.net.il 25
<br>[18:11] *** SnIpEr_WoLf_ has joined #bsrf
<br>[18:11] &lt;Raven> telnet mailgw.netvision.net.il 25
<br>[18:12] &lt;Raven> port 25, this is important
<br>[18:12] &lt;Raven> smtp runs on port 25
<br>[18:12] &lt;c0c0> yea
<br>[18:12] &lt;Chaotic_Thought> I'm on...
<br>[18:12] &lt;squiler> we get like sendmail version etc...
<br>[18:12] &lt;TheJoker> running sendmail
<br>[18:12] &lt;Chaotic_Thought> 8.9.3 sendmail
<br>[18:12] &lt;Raven> yup
<br>[18:12] &lt;Raven> 220 alpha.netvision.net.il ESMTP Sendmail 8.9.3/8.8.6;
Sat, 22 Jan 2000 19:14:41 +0200 (IST)
<br>[18:12] &lt;TheJoker> a linux/unix?
<br>[18:12] &lt;Raven> this is what u get
<br>[18:12] *** Sniper_wolf__ has joined #bsrf
<br>[18:12] &lt;Raven> this is a daemon banner
<br>[18:13] &lt;c0c0> hmmmm, oki
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> btw check blacksun.box.sk/ports.txt for a list of
standard ports
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> now, what does it tell us?
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> ooh, sendmail
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> the dumbest daemon ever
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> it just gave us the version of the daemon that is
running
<br>[18:13] &lt;TheJoker> it's a unix type sys
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> usually, in sendmail holes, the OS doesn't matter
much
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> yup
<br>[18:13] &lt;Raven> now, suppose we're some script kiddie
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> so we have the version
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> of the daemon
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> now we go to, say, packetstorm.securify.com
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> or neworder.box.sk
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> and we search
<br>[18:14] &lt;INTJ> bugtraq
<br>[18:14] &lt;INTJ> technotronic
<br>[18:14] &lt;INTJ> ;p
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> we use keywords such as "sendmail 8.9.3"
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> yes, bugtraq is good too
<br>[18:14] &lt;Chaotic_Thought> look for a crack/bug
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> yup
<br>[18:14] &lt;INTJ> ntbugtraq.com
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> now, here is what we'll find
<br>[18:14] &lt;Raven> we could find:
<br>[18:15] &lt;TheJoker> that's pathetic!
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> a) advisories
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> these hardly mean anything to crackers
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> they only explain to u how to fix the hole
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> and a little technical backgruond
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> and a little technical background
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> which the common script kiddie won't be interested
in
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> b) texts
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> texts will detail the hole
<br>[18:15] &lt;Raven> how to exploit it
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> and a workaround, if any
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> c) an exploit
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> BINGO!
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> an exploit is a premade program
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> that exploits a certain hole
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> all the cracker has to do is to compile it
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> (unless it's written in perl)
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> (or another interpreted programming language)
<br>[18:16] &lt;INTJ> bash
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> ('cause they run in the form of source code)
<br>[18:16] &lt;Chaotic_Thought> So crackers are usally lazy punks...
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> yes, or a shell script
<br>[18:16] &lt;Raven> although u'll hardly ever found exploits in the
form of shell scripts
<br>[18:16] &lt;INTJ> pamslam.sh
<br>[18:16] &lt;INTJ> heheh ;p
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> sniperwolf missed everything from phase one 'till
"the dumbest daemon ever"
<br>[18:17] &lt;INTJ> redhat and mandrake rooter
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> can anyone plz help him?
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> i'm kinda busy here with the lecture and everything
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> other daemons a cracker might want to look at:
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> ftp
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> by logging into ftp servers
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> when logging into ftp servers
<br>[18:17] &lt;Raven> u usually get technical information about the system
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> u could also try to issue the syst command
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> which will also give away some information
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> webservers
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> if u issue a bad url request
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> it'll give u some info
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> for example: try surfing to http://blacksun.box.sk/some-dead-link.html
<br>[18:18] &lt;c0c0> like they are usun apache
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> it'll give u an error msg
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> and the name and version of the webserver program
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> fairly easy
<br>[18:18] &lt;Raven> all u need is a browser
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> crackers can also utilize newsgroups daemons
<br>[18:19] &lt;TheJoker> how bout pop mail?
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> and others
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> pop mail too
<br>[18:19] &lt;Chaotic_Thought> Apache 1.3.6 port 80
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> pop3 usually reveals information
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> ftp port 21
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> news port...
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> 119, i think
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> pop is...
<br>[18:19] &lt;TheJoker> telnet
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> uhh, damn
<br>[18:19] &lt;INTJ> 110 = pop
<br>[18:19] &lt;TheJoker> 110
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> yeah
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> telnet too
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> telnet to port 23
<br>[18:19] &lt;c0c0> yep 119 if it is not a secure connection
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> go ahead and telnet to blacksun.box.sk on port 23
<br>[18:19] &lt;Raven> u'll get some info on the system
<br>[18:20] &lt;Raven> but what if we change this information?
<br>[18:20] *** Sniper_wolf__ has quit IRC (IL.Quit: I was using Ghost_Rider
Script version 2.0)
<br>[18:20] &lt;Raven> most of today's server programs let u do it
<br>[18:20] &lt;TheJoker> most admins do it.
<br>[18:20] &lt;squiler> redhat linux 5.2 --- you learn the os
<br>[18:20] &lt;c0c0> Kernel 2.0.36 on an i586
<br>[18:20] &lt;squiler> and the system
<br>[18:20] &lt;Raven> so suppose we've changed the daemon banner
<br>[18:20] &lt;TheJoker> Red Hat Linux release 1.2 (Apollo)
<br>[18:20] &lt;Raven> but what if...
<br>[18:20] &lt;squiler> ...
<br>[18:20] &lt;Raven> we're dealing with a smarter script kiddie?
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> (ph33r)
<br>[18:21] &lt;squiler> they exist?
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> yeah
<br>[18:21] &lt;squiler> :)
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> there are some
<br>[18:21] &lt;TheJoker> nmap!
<br>[18:21] &lt;INTJ> yes, unfortunately ;p
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> yup
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> www.insecure.org
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> download nmap
<br>[18:21] &lt;c0c0> queso may be?
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> how does nmap work?
<br>[18:21] &lt;INTJ> winfingerptint.exe
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> queso too
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> winfingerprint too
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> winfingerprint is for windows
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> the others are for unix
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> get them all at packetstorm.securify.com
<br>[18:21] &lt;INTJ> windows nt
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> how do they work?
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> pretty simple
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> each OS has what we call tcp/ip fingerprints
<br>[18:21] &lt;Raven> why?
<br>[18:22] &lt;TheJoker> it trys all these same techniques don't it?
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> because each os implements tcp/ip in a different
way
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> kinda
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> yeah
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> basically, nmap and the others are just port scanners
<br>[18:22] &lt;TheJoker> ya now I remember
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> but they do more
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> they can detect these fingerprints
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> and give definitive information
<br>[18:22] &lt;INTJ> this irc server gives a lot if advertising msgs..
<br>[18:22] &lt;TheJoker> the win tcp/ip stack is easy to detect
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> yes, it's the easiest
<br>[18:22] &lt;Raven> windows is the easiest to detect
<br>[18:23] &lt;Raven> detecting the difference between two similar unix
distributions is harder
<br>[18:23] &lt;Raven> detecting the differences between, say, some unix
and windows
<br>[18:23] &lt;Raven> or mac and windows
<br>[18:23] &lt;Raven> is fairly easy
<br>[18:23] &lt;Seeker> could you spoof fingerprints? as an admin i mean
<br>[18:23] &lt;Raven> so our smart and elite script kiddie grabs his copy
of nmap
<br>[18:23] &lt;INTJ> how bout between linux distro or *bsd?
<br>[18:23] &lt;TheJoker> but nmap uses a combo of all the techniques.
<br>[18:23] &lt;Raven> technically, u can, but it takes a lot of messing
around with code and stuff
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> and u probably won't be able to do it well
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> nor hide from all techniques
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> also, nmap does other things
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> it's a portscanner that can also scan through firewalls
<br>[18:24] &lt;TheJoker> but do your really have too hide?
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> more on nmap's website and nmap's man pages
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> (it installs a manpage)
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> (so u type man nmap after u install it)
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> (and it explains everything)
<br>[18:24] &lt;Raven> www.insecure.org/nmap
<br>[18:25] &lt;TheJoker> arent your lost in say ftp trafic when ftping?
<br>[18:25] &lt;Raven> well, if u reveal critical information about ur
system
<br>[18:25] &lt;Raven> u might be helping a cracker
<br>[18:25] &lt;Raven> TheJoker: say again plz?
<br>[18:25] &lt;TheJoker> does the cracker have to worry about hiding?
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> yes
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> so the cracker would implement some techniques
<br>[18:26] &lt;TheJoker> wont' he/she be lost in trafic?
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> such as the ones described in blacksun.box.sk/anonymity.txt
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> generally, yes
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> but there are IDSs
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> IDS = Intrusion Detection System
<br>[18:26] &lt;TheJoker> dynamic IPs now days
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> they go over traffic
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> and highlight several parts in the logs
<br>[18:26] &lt;squiler> is a proxy enough to hide?
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> which might mean a cracking attempt
<br>[18:26] *** c0c0 has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<br>[18:26] &lt;Raven> bouncing ur connection would usually suffice
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> okay, that's it. if u miss something, just wait
for the logs to come out
<br>[18:27] &lt;INTJ> if the proxy party cooperate w/ us ;p
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> or...
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> suppose we telnet to nether.net
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> and get a free shell account
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> and then break out
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> and manage to get root
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> (suppose we do it from a public place so they can't
trace us back home)
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> now we have a root shell on nether.net
<br>[18:27] &lt;Raven> and we can run exploits and hack from them
<br>[18:27] &lt;TheJoker>&nbsp; http://freebooks.hypermart.net/proxy/proxiesn.htm
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:28] &lt;TheJoker> free proxies worldwide
<br>[18:28] &lt;squiler> nether.net is the best free shell provider
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> okay, so these were phase one and two
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> phase one - info gathering
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> two - searching online databases
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> now, suppose we're in
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> now comes phase three
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> no, not defacing the website!
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> or dns database
<br>[18:28] &lt;Raven> we have some other things to worry about
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> first we need to clean out presence from the logs
<br>[18:29] &lt;TheJoker> logs?
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> or the admin might realize he got cracked
<br>[18:29] &lt;squiler> thats what i'm doing right now
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> and put more effort into security
<br>[18:29] &lt;squiler> :)
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:29] &lt;INTJ> this is where rootkit comes in ;p
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> not these logs!
<br>[18:29] &lt;squiler> hahaha
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> yeah, rootkits automate such processes
<br>[18:29] &lt;TheJoker> :p)
<br>[18:29] *** INTJ has quit IRC (No route to host)
<br>[18:29] * Chaotic_Thought grins
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> fun for the whole family
<br>[18:29] &lt;squiler> how does a rootkit actaully work?
<br>[18:29] &lt;Raven> so now that we've cleaned our presence from the
logs
<br>[18:30] &lt;Raven> it's just an automated script
<br>[18:30] &lt;Raven> it automates some tasks for u
<br>[18:30] &lt;Raven> they only work on specific configurations
<br>[18:30] *** INTJ has joined #bsrf
<br>[18:30] &lt;Raven> of course, if we only clean the standard logs like
klog (kernel logger) and syslog (system logger)
<br>[18:30] &lt;INTJ> shoot, israel.net closed me
<br>[18:30] &lt;Raven> it might now be enough
<br>[18:30] &lt;Raven> don't worry, just get someone to give u the logs
at the end of the lecture
<br>[18:31] &lt;Raven> okay, so if we only cleaned syslog and klog
<br>[18:31] &lt;Raven> we might have still left some trace
<br>[18:31] &lt;Raven> maybe the admin is using an external logging system?
<br>[18:31] &lt;Raven> could be...
<br>[18:31] &lt;TheJoker> in being rooted?
<br>[18:31] &lt;Raven> hey, when ur done with the lecture, plz send the
logs to tplec@zipmail.com.br (sniper wolf) and to me (barakirs@netvision.net.il)
<br>[18:31] &lt;Raven> now, suppose we're a cracker
<br>[18:31] &lt;Raven> and we've cleaned syslog and klog
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> but the admin was using some external logger
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> WHOOPS!
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> we've left some presence
<br>[18:32] &lt;TheJoker> dead
<br>[18:32] &lt;Seeker> wed be screwed..
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> now, phase 4

<br>[18:32] &lt;squiler> how do you get around that?
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> so u need to do some research on the machine
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> browse around in it's directories
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> see what u can find
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> and of course, u must have a lot of experience
<br>[18:32] &lt;Seeker> can one practice that?
<br>[18:32] &lt;Raven> install some log cleaners on urself
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> mess around with external logging programs
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> etc' etc'
<br>[18:33] &lt;TheJoker> skript kiddies dont though
<br>[18:33] &lt;INTJ> rootkit
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> that's right
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> u can practice that on ur own box
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> script kiddies hardly ever practice
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> the average script kiddie would skip phases 3 and
4
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> phase 3 - deleting urself from the logs
<br>[18:33] &lt;INTJ> rootkit can make logging exclude our doings
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> phase 4 - installing a backdoor
<br>[18:33] &lt;Raven> (we'll get to that)
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> btw, DO NOT just delete the logs!
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> this will surely get the admin to notice
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> DUH!!
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> that's the dumbest thing u could possibly do
<br>[18:34] &lt;TheJoker> just your intries!
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> exactly
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> u can also change ur entries
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> and make them look like something more legitimate
<br>[18:34] &lt;Raven> of course, u have to make sure they look authentic
<br>[18:34] &lt;TheJoker> skript kiddies would'nt know thier entries form
others would they?
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> yup - experience with loggers
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> yeah
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> okay, let's move on
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> suppose this whole process of cracking into the
machine and cleaning the logs
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> took u...
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> 5 minutes...
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> 30 minutes...
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> maybe a couple of hours
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> a day?
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> ;-)
<br>[18:35] &lt;Seeker> *g*
<br>[18:35] &lt;Raven> u wouldn't want to repeat that whenever u step in,
would u?
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> this is what backdoors are for
<br>[18:36] &lt;squiler> hell no
<br>[18:36] &lt;TheJoker> no
<br>[18:36] &lt;TheJoker> ya!
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> the most basic one is:
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> useradd my-backdoor
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> password my-backdoor my-new-pass
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> we've just added a new user
<br>[18:36] &lt;INTJ> passwd
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> oops
<br>[18:36] &lt;TheJoker> you would'nt use my-backdoor!
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> passwd my-backdoor my-new-pass
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> sorry
<br>[18:36] &lt;Raven> yes, of course
<br>[18:37] &lt;INTJ> adduser
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> or useradd
<br>[18:37] &lt;TheJoker> haha
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> depends on the system
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> and on...
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> nevermind!
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> off-topic
<br>[18:37] &lt;TheJoker> hehe
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> it really doesn't matter
<br>[18:37] &lt;INTJ> you wanna do clickings in win ;p
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> now we edit the passwd file
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> and give the new account uid 0 and gid 0
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> user id 0 = root access!
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> access to ANYTHING
<br>[18:37] &lt;Seeker> not always
<br>[18:37] &lt;Raven> group id 0 = root's group
<br>[18:38] &lt;Raven> yes, of course
<br>[18:38] &lt;Raven> but usually
<br>[18:38] &lt;Raven> u can change anything on unix boxes
<br>[18:38] &lt;Seeker> SuSE has extreme restrictions, then you cant do
some stuff
<br>[18:38] &lt;TheJoker> the admin would notice a new god mode user!
<br>[18:38] &lt;Raven> exactly!
<br>[18:38] &lt;Raven> that's why it's the most obvious backdoor
<br>[18:38] &lt;INTJ> there's a program for unix that can restrict uid
0 guid 0 permissions
<br>[18:38] &lt;Raven> a new god user would fire up some alarms, now wouldn't
it?
<br>[18:38] &lt;Raven> that's also true
<br>[18:38] &lt;TheJoker> ya!
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> so no smart cracker would use this method
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> another possible method:
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> taking some backdoor noone uses
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> and trojan it
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> oops, i mean daemon
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> taking some daemon
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> and trojaning it
<br>[18:39] &lt;TheJoker> what about cracking the passwd file?
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> no, we already have root access
<br>[18:39] &lt;INTJ> sshd daemon is a good one
<br>[18:39] &lt;Raven> usually u won't need root's password
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> u'll just run an exploit and get a root shell
<br>[18:40] &lt;TheJoker> but after your in
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> another possible backdoor:
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> trojaning some daemon
<br>[18:40] &lt;TheJoker> crack it and then you'll be able to get back
in
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> so the daemon would appear to be working just fine
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> and will do everything naturally
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> but will also allow the cracker to get a root shell
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> but...
<br>[18:40] &lt;Raven> what if the admin is running checksum checks?
<br>[18:41] &lt;INTJ> tripwire
<br>[18:41] &lt;Seeker> change them too... only problem left: time stamps
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> there are programs out there, such as tripwire,
which check the file sizes of files
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> and let's the admin know when they're changed
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> critical files
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> that's true too
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> the file's "last changed date" would also change
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> sure, u can go around all of this...
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> but this only means more variables
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> more places where u can fail
<br>[18:41] &lt;Raven> or make a mistake
<br>[18:41] &lt;TheJoker> you could change sys time before you mod the
file :p)
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> and reveal urself
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> of course, but that would be noticed
<br>[18:42] *** [S]hun has joined #bsrf
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> this is one of the main reasons that u need to make
sure the admin is not present when u crack
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> using finger
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> if finger is available
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> finger @target-host.com
<br>[18:42] &lt;TheJoker> not much anymore.
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> yeah
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> it's hard to find an admin
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> that is dumb enough
<br>[18:42] &lt;Raven> to run finger!
<br>[18:43] &lt;INTJ> who
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> suppose netvision.net.il (my isp) was running fingerd
(finger daemon)
<br>[18:43] &lt;INTJ> run 'who'
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> ppl would just be able to do finger barakirs@netvision.net.il
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> and get tons of information about me
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> yes, of course, once you're in, u can use commands
such as who
<br>[18:43] &lt;squiler> you would have to be on the system to use who
<br>[18:43] &lt;INTJ> ps aux
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> exactly
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> ps -aux
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> this will show ALL running processes
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> useful too
<br>[18:43] &lt;Raven> sometimes to find loggers
<br>[18:44] &lt;Raven> but the admin can change the process names of the
loggers
<br>[18:44] &lt;INTJ> we can send the admin xxx passwd to distract him
;p
<br>[18:44] &lt;Raven> now, here's another method
<br>[18:44] &lt;Raven> using the r services
<br>[18:44] &lt;Raven> especially rlogin
<br>[18:44] &lt;Raven> go read rlogin's man page
<br>[18:44] &lt;Raven> wait, lemme quote it
<br>[18:44] &lt;Raven> okay, nm, lemme write something of my own
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> rlogin is based on trust systems
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> for example:
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> suppose u require anyone who comes over to ur house
to give a password
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> three knocks or something
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> some password...
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> but suddenly, ur best friends comes over
<br>[18:45] &lt;TheJoker> 4 is better
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> and he doesn't know the password
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> :-)
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> will u let him in?
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> of course u will!
<br>[18:45] &lt;Seeker> no
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> u trust him
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> lol
<br>[18:45] &lt;TheJoker> heck no!
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> u wouldn't
<br>[18:45] &lt;Raven> trust systems would
<br>[18:46] &lt;TheJoker> they suck!
<br>[18:46] &lt;Raven> they're also good for more user-friendlyness
<br>[18:46] &lt;TheJoker> I don't want my ps to be friendly
<br>[18:46] &lt;squiler> send me the log please i must go
<br>[18:46] &lt;Raven> so dumb clerks won't have to type in passwords all
the time
<br>[18:46] &lt;TheJoker> sorry pc
<br>[18:46] &lt;Seeker> micro$oft? *eg*
<br>[18:46] *** squiler has quit IRC (IL.Quit: Leaving)
<br>[18:46] &lt;Raven> now, trust systems are also serious security hazards
<br>[18:47] &lt;Raven> go to blacksun.box.sk/books.html and read 'IP Spoofing
Demystified' later
<br>[18:47] &lt;Raven> now, let's take rlogin for example
<br>[18:47] &lt;TheJoker> it was good.
<br>[18:47] &lt;Raven> suppose u put a file:
<br>[18:47] &lt;Raven> called /etc/rhosts
<br>[18:47] &lt;Raven> put a file called rhosts in /etc
<br>[18:47] &lt;Raven> which will look like this:
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> somehost.com someuser
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> the user someuser from somehost.com will be able
to do:
<br>[18:48] &lt;TheJoker> loggers would catch it?
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> just a sec
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> he'll be able to use rlogin
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> to remotely login to this bx
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> to remotely login to this box
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> as ANY user
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> or if u put an .rhosts file in a user's home directory
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> he'll be able to log in as that user
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> ANOTHER POSSIBLE BACKDOOR!
<br>[18:48] &lt;Raven> but wait...
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> that's fairly noticable, isn't it?
<br>[18:49] &lt;TheJoker> ya
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> most backdoors are
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> so we need to put a lot of thought into it
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> and some luck
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> and make sure the admin is as dumb as possible
<br>[18:49] &lt;TheJoker> should you make backup back doors?
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> yes
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> always
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> on the other hand
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> more backdoors
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> would mean more chances
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> that the admin will notice something wrong
<br>[18:49] &lt;Raven> suppose u were an admin
<br>[18:50] &lt;TheJoker> like a stupid one to make them think that they
got you?
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> and u would have suddenly noticed a backdoor
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> u would panic, right?
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> and put a lot more effort into security
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> download every scanner u can find
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> roam your system for backdoors and holes
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> perhaps
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> but they might find the stupid backdoor
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> and then go crazy
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> search the system
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> and find ur other backdoors
<br>[18:50] &lt;TheJoker> ya it's all luck,
<br>[18:50] &lt;INTJ> but a very smart admin had setup a honeypot ;p
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> exactly
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> yup
<br>[18:50] &lt;Raven> honeypots are kewl
<br>[18:51] &lt;Raven> he would attract a cracker
<br>[18:51] &lt;Raven> and then...
<br>[18:51] &lt;Raven> KABOOM!!
<br>[18:51] &lt;[S]hun> Whats honeypot ?
<br>[18:51] &lt;TheJoker> ;P)
<br>[18:51] &lt;Raven> or something...
<br>[18:51] &lt;TheJoker> boobie trap
<br>[18:51] &lt;Raven> a honeypot is a host or a certain situation that
will attract crackers
<br>[18:51] &lt;INTJ> KABOOM? the mail bomber? ;p hahaha
<br>[18:51] &lt;Raven> the admin will monitor his honeypot
<br>[18:51] &lt;Raven> see if there are any bees trapped inside
<br>[18:52] &lt;Raven> and then, once he sees something...
<br>[18:52] &lt;Raven> he would realize that he's being attacked
<br>[18:52] &lt;Raven> and maybe call the police
<br>[18:52] &lt;Raven> or Robert Frost!!
<br>[18:52] &lt;Raven> MWHAHAHAHA!!

<br>[18:52] &lt;Raven> private joke
<br>[18:52] &lt;TheJoker> sounds like a personal problem

<br>[18:53] &lt;Raven> utilize the box
<br>[18:53] &lt;Raven> perhaps for mailbombing someone
<br>[18:53] &lt;Raven> perhaps for installing bots on it
<br>[18:53] &lt;Raven> or flooding
<br>[18:53] &lt;INTJ> vhost

<br>[18:53] &lt;INTJ> hack another box
<br>[18:53] *** rekaerf has joined #bsrf
<br>[18:53] &lt;Raven> yup, u can also set a virtual host on this box
<br>[18:53] &lt;rekaerf> hey
<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> yes, or start other attacks against other hosts
from this newly cracked one
<br>[18:54] &lt;TheJoker> or just screw the system and kill a business
<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> yes, that's also true
<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> or...
<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> corporate espionage
<br>[18:54] &lt;TheJoker> yummy!
<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> if ur a corporate spy
<br>[18:54] &lt;INTJ> credit card numbers ;p
<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> u could get info and stuff

<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> or other sensitive information
<br>[18:54] &lt;Raven> so that was phase 5
<br>[18:55] &lt;Raven> which is...
<br>[18:55] &lt;Raven> well, the last phase
<br>[18:55] &lt;Seeker> LOL
<br>[18:55] &lt;Raven> thank u all for coming over to the lecture
