<DIV align=center><BIG><BIG><BIG><B>Securing IGS Cisco Routers v 
1.01<BR></B></BIG></BIG></BIG></DIV><BR><BR>This paper will describe how you 
should obtain remote and local, information about an IGS Cisco Router. It&#8217;s 
recommended if you have some experience with configuring Cisco Routers before 
reading this paper, by the way it doesn&#8217;t matter which model you own. And more 
important, you must own and know how to use a Unix oriented operating system. 
After we have collected some information that is useful to us, we&#8217;ll try to 
secure the router as good as possible. And please note, this paper is for 
educational purposes only and I&#8217;m not responsible in any way for your stupid 
actions if you&#8217;ll be caught.<BR><BR>Because the probability you don&#8217;t have an 
IGS Cisco Router but a newer model like the IOS, it could happen you get 
different outputs at programs like &#8220;nmap&#8221;. Also while securing the router it&#8217;s 
possible you have to use some other commands than I do. Grab your manual if you 
have one and try to find the correct command.<BR><BIG><BR></BIG><BIG><B>Getting 
the information remote:</B></BIG><BR><BR>I assume you already have configured 
you Cisco Router and your Unix box with the proper outfit. But because I know 
there still are people who don&#8217;t know where to download the tools we&#8217;re going to 
use, I&#8217;ve placed some links at the bottom of this paper which could be 
useful.<BR><BR>I always start with an &#8220;nmap&#8221;-scan, we need to know first which 
daemons are running at the remote host. Because I do own a couple of IGS Cisco 
Routers myself, I&#8217;ll use the router with IP &#8220;169.254.0.10&#8221; for this paper. A 
daemon can listen on various sockets, like UDP, TCP, IPX and SPX it could take a 
long time before they all are scanned. And if you&#8217;re not at the same segment as 
where the remote router is located, it&#8217;s completely useless to scan sockets 
other than TCP and UDP. Protocols other than 802.3(Standard LLC, SNAP LLC and 
RAW) &amp; IP will standard not be rotated by any (internet)-router!<BR><BR>Well 
we only will scan all listening TCP and UDP sockets and we use the following 
command at the Unix shell: &#8220;nmap -sT -sU -p 1-65535 169.254.0.10&#8221;. For a 
complete overview of all possibilities type: &#8220;man nmap&#8221;.<BR><BR>Port &nbsp;

while many Gopher daemons will only listen on 70/TCP, every daemon uses it&#8217;s 
standard port. Of course you can configure the daemon so it listens at a 
different port. So it&#8217;s possible that &#8216;behind&#8217; 79/TCP at the IGS Cisco Router 
there is listening another daemon then a finger daemon. There are two ways to 
discover what daemon will really listen on a socket, one search in your IGS 
Cisco Router manual; two establish a telnet session to the daemon. I&#8217;m trying to 
establish a telnet session to all daemons, most times you get enough information 
from the &#8216;banner&#8217;.<BR><BR>Echo (7/TCP&amp;UDP)<BR><BR>SorNOT:~ # telnet

<DIV align=left><BIG><B>Securing IGS-CR</B></BIG><BR></DIV><BR>We need the 
combination of the remote and locally gathered information to stop the 
unnecessary daemons&#8230; We have several ways to do this:<BR><BR>The simplest way is 
to use the program &#8216;setup&#8217;. Here we can say for example, do not load the SNMP 
daemon by simple entering &#8216;yes or no&#8217; by the options. <BR>I know not many people 
will try this way to unload the unnecessary daemons, because: one it&#8217;s not easy 
to find; and two you really have to know what you&#8217;re doing. But it&#8217;s possible to 
read out the whole memory stack and find the right offset of a daemon and 
rewrite the memory so the daemon will be killed. <BR>As far I know the IGS 
series do not have an internal (network) firewall or such, properly the newer 
ones does have it. I will not discuss how to set-up the firewall, because simply 
said I don&#8217;t know how to do this right now. What I do want to mention is with 
this type of firewall you have the option to filter the daemons for unwanted 
connections. You can create rules like, 169.254.0.11 may connect to the telnet 
daemon but 169.254.0.20 may not. Well you get the idea, don&#8217;t you? <BR><BR>To 
completely secure the IGS-CR we have to use the first two ways, first we use way 
one and if then not all unnecessary daemons are stopped we&#8217;re using way two too. 
It&#8217;s possible that you want to kill different daemons then I&#8217;m going to do&#8230; most 
likely were talking about daemons who can&#8217;t be stopped with the &#8216;setup&#8217; menu. 
And daemons that can&#8217;t be stopped with way one have to be stopped with way two, 
and that requires a lot of search-time by yourself.<BR><BR>Way one is rather 
simple, just type in &#8220;setup&#8221; and walk through the menu. To verify afterwards you 
have stopped some unnecessary daemons type, &#8220;show processes&#8221; before and after 
you have walked through the setup. Compare both outputs with each other, and see 
for yourself if something has changed.<BR><BR>I know that you cannot stop all 
unnecessary daemons with this setup program, but I try to show you how to stop 
them &#8216;the second way&#8217;&#8230;<BR><BR>I&#8217;m going try to stop the daemon listed

the command &#8220;write memory or erase [start stack &#8211; end stack] [new

the so called PID address, because this depends which router you&#8217;re have I&#8217;m not 
going to explain this any further. Just find the appropriate command in your 
Cisco Router manual.<BR><BR>After you have killed some daemons check if they are 
really stopped. I know that rewriting the stack is a tricky operation, and it 
could be that your Cisco Router will stop functioning. To reset all data in the 
NVRAM (where all configuration is being stored) type in the enabled mode &#8220;erase 
startup config&#8221; and &#8220;reload&#8221;. Remember while doing so, you loose all your 
configuration and such. The first time the Cisco Router is booting from flash 
memory, consult your Cisco Router manual for specific 
information.<BR><BR><BR>Ok, so far for this time&#8230; I have to spend my other hours 
at learning myself more about Cisco Systems products.<BR><BR>Some
