A firewall is basically something that protects the network from the Internet.&nbsp;<br>
It is derived from the concept of&nbsp;<br>
firewalls used in vehicles which is a barrier made of fire resistant material&nbsp;<br>
protecting the vehicle in case of&nbsp;<br>
fire. Anyway a firewall is best described as a software or hardware or both&nbsp;<br>
Hardware and Software packet&nbsp;<br>
filter that allows only selected packets to pass through from the Internet to&nbsp;<br>
your private internal network.&nbsp;<br>
A firewall is a system or a group of systems which guard a trusted network( The&nbsp;<br>
Internal Private Network&nbsp;<br>
from the untrusted network (the Internet.) To understand how a firewall works,&nbsp;<br>
firstly we need to understand&nbsp;<br>
how exactly data is transferred on the Internet.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
NOTE: The following is a very weird, short and incomplete description of the&nbsp;<br>
TCP\IP protocol, I have just&nbsp;<br>
given a general idea of the whole data transmission process so that everyone can&nbsp;<br>
understand firewalls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The TCP\IP suite is responsible for successful transfer of data across a network&nbsp;<br>
both the Internet and the&nbsp;<br>
Intranet. The TCP\IP suite is a collection of protocols which are inter-related&nbsp;<br>
and interdependent and act as a&nbsp;<br>
set of rules according to which data is transferred across the network. A protocol&nbsp;<br>
can be defined as a language&nbsp;<br>
or a standard which is followed while transfer of data takes place. Lets go&nbsp;<br>
through a brief explanation of how&nbsp;<br>
data is transferred across a network following the various components of the&nbsp;<br>
TCP\IP suite.&nbsp;<br>
The whole process of data transmission begins when a user starts up an Internet&nbsp;<br>
application like the email&nbsp;<br>
client or a FTP client. The user types an email in his client and in this way&nbsp;<br>
provides data to be&nbsp;<br>
transferred. The email client is said to be a part of the application layer of&nbsp;<br>
the TCP\IP stack. Now this&nbsp;<br>
application layer (email client) provides data (the email itself) which has to be&nbsp;<br>
transferred to the Transmission&nbsp;<br>
control protocol or TCP which constitutes the Transfer Layer of TCP\IP. TCP breaks&nbsp;<br>
down the data i.e. the&nbsp;<br>
email into smaller chunks called packets and hands over the responsibility to the&nbsp;<br>
Internet Protocol or IP&nbsp;<br>
which forms the invisible network layer. This Internet Protocol adds some various&nbsp;<br>
info to each packet to&nbsp;<br>
ensure that the packet knows for which computer it is meant for and which port&nbsp;<br>
or application it is going to&nbsp;<br>
meet and from where it has come. An IP datagram contains:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1. A header which contains the Source and Destination IP, Time to live info and&nbsp;<br>
also the protocol&nbsp;<br>
used. There is also a header checksum present.&nbsp;<br>
2. Remaining part contains the data to be transferred.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You do not need to understand all this in detail but just remember that TCP&nbsp;<br>
breaks data into smaller packets&nbsp;<br>
and IP adds the source and destination IP's to the packets. When the data reaches&nbsp;<br>
the other server IP hands&nbsp;<br>
the packets to TCP again which re assembles the packets. Port numbers are also&nbsp;<br>
used to ensure that the&nbsp;<br>
packets know to which application it need to go to. So, basically we can conclude&nbsp;<br>
that a successful&nbsp;<br>
transmission of data across a network relies on the source and destination IP&nbsp;<br>
and also the ports.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A firewall too relies on the source and destination IP and also the ports to&nbsp;<br>
control the packet transfer between&nbsp;<br>
the untrusted network and the trusted network. Firewalls can be classified into 3&nbsp;<br>
types:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1. Packet Filter Firewalls&nbsp;<br>
2. Application proxy Firewalls&nbsp;<br>
3. Packet Inspection Firewalls&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Packet Filter Firewalls&nbsp;<br>
<br>
They are the earliest and the most criticized firewalls, which nowadays are not&nbsp;<br>
easily found. They are usually&nbsp;<br>
Hardware based i.e. Router Based (a router is a piece of device which connects two&nbsp;<br>
networks together.)&nbsp;<br>
Whenever a Packet Filter Firewall receives a packet for permission to pass&nbsp;<br>
through, it compares the header&nbsp;<br>
information i.e. the source and destination IP address, and port number with a&nbsp;<br>
table of predefined access&nbsp;<br>
control rules If the header information matches, then the packet is allowed to&nbsp;<br>
pass else the packet is&nbsp;<br>
dropped or terminated. They are not popular due to the fact that they allow&nbsp;<br>
direct contact between the&nbsp;<br>
untrusted system and the trusted private system.&nbsp;<br>
To understand such firewalls lets take the example of the secretary that sits in&nbsp;<br>
your office. This kind of&nbsp;<br>
secretary allows only those people who have an appointment to pass but if you&nbsp;<br>
convince her that her boss&nbsp;<br>
wants to meet her then she would allow you to pass.&nbsp;<br>
Such Firewalls can be fooled by using techniques like IP Spoofing in which we&nbsp;<br>
can change the source&nbsp;<br>
IP such that the firewall thinks that the packet has come from a trusted system&nbsp;<br>
which is among the list of&nbsp;<br>
systems which have access through the firewall.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Application proxy Firewalls&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The shortcomings of the packet filter firewalls are addressed by the new type of&nbsp;<br>
firewalls developed by&nbsp;<br>
the DARPA. It was widely believed that the earlier type of firewalls were not&nbsp;<br>
secure enough as they allowed&nbsp;<br>
the untrusted systems to have a direct connection with the trusted systems. This&nbsp;<br>
problem was solved with&nbsp;<br>
the use of Proxy servers as firewalls. A proxy server which is used as a&nbsp;<br>
firewall are called application proxy&nbsp;<br>
servers.&nbsp;<br>
This kind of a proxy firewall examines what application or service (running on&nbsp;<br>
ports) a packet is meant for&nbsp;<br>
and if that particular service is available only then is the packet allowed to&nbsp;<br>
pass through and if the service is&nbsp;<br>
unavailable then the packet is discarded or dropped by the firewall. Once this&nbsp;<br>
is done, the firewall extracts&nbsp;<br>
the data and delivers it to the appropriate service. There is not direct&nbsp;<br>
connection between the untrusted&nbsp;<br>
systems with the trusted systems as the original data sent by the untrusted&nbsp;<br>
system is dropped by the firewall&nbsp;<br>
and it personally delivers the data.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Let's again take the example of a secretary. Such a secretary would take a gift&nbsp;<br>
or something else for you&nbsp;<br>
only if you are available in the office and it would not allow the visitor to&nbsp;<br>
deliver the thing but would personally&nbsp;<br>
deliver it to you. Although they are somewhat slower, they are much more&nbsp;<br>
secure as they do not allow&nbsp;<br>
a direct contact between an untrusted network and a trusted network.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Packet Inspection Firewalls&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It can be also known as an extension of the Packet Filter Firewall. It not only&nbsp;<br>
verifies the source and&nbsp;<br>
destination IP's and ports, it also takes into consideration or verifies that&nbsp;<br>
content of the data before passing it&nbsp;<br>
through. There are two ways in which this kind of a firewall verifies the data to&nbsp;<br>
be passed:&nbsp;<br>
State and Session.&nbsp;<br>
In case of state inspection, an incoming packet is allowed to pass through only&nbsp;<br>
if there is a matching&nbsp;<br>
outward bound request for this packet. This means that the incoming packet is&nbsp;<br>
allowed to pass through only&nbsp;<br>
if the trusted server had requested for it or had sent an invitation for it.&nbsp;<br>
In case of session filtering, the data of the incoming is not verified, but&nbsp;<br>
instead the network activity is traced&nbsp;<br>
and once a trusted system ends the session, no further packets from that system&nbsp;<br>
pertaining to that session&nbsp;<br>
are allowed to pass through. This protects against IP spoofing to a certain&nbsp;<br>
extend.&nbsp;<br>
Such firewalls can also be configured beforehand to act according to pre defined&nbsp;<br>
rules when it is attacked. It&nbsp;<br>
can also be configured to disconnect from the Internet in case of an attack.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All along you will come across many Firewalls on various systems, basically a&nbsp;<br>
firewall can be established&nbsp;<br>
or setup in two ways:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1. Dual-homed gateway&nbsp;<br>
2. Demilitarized zone (DMZ)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In a dual homed gateway firewall, there is a single firewall with 2 connections,&nbsp;<br>
one for the trusted network&nbsp;<br>
and the other for the untrusted network.&nbsp;<br>
In the case of a Demilitarized Firewall or a DMZ there are two firewalls, each&nbsp;<br>
with two connections, but there&nbsp;<br>
is a slight difference in the case of a DMZ setup.&nbsp;<br>
In the case of a DMZ setup, there are two firewalls, the first having two&nbsp;<br>
connections, one leading to the&nbsp;<br>
untrusted network and the other leading to the host systems like the email&nbsp;<br>
server or the FTP server etc.&nbsp;<br>
These host systems can be accessed from the untrusted network. These host systems&nbsp;<br>
are connected with the&nbsp;<br>
internal private trusted systems through another firewall. Thus there is no&nbsp;<br>
direct contact between the&nbsp;<br>
untrusted network and the trusted internal network. The area or region between&nbsp;<br>
the two firewalls is termed as&nbsp;<br>
the demilitarized zone.&nbsp;<br>
In the case of a Dual Homed Gateway the untrusted network is connected to the&nbsp;<br>
host systems (email&nbsp;<br>
and FTP servers etc) through a firewall and these host systems are connected to&nbsp;<br>
the internal private&nbsp;<br>
network. There is no second firewall between the host systems and the internal&nbsp;<br>
private trusted network.&nbsp;<br>
The basic structure of the DMZ setup declares it to be a more secure system as&nbsp;<br>
even if an attacker gets&nbsp;<br>
through the first firewall, he just reaches the host systems, while the internal&nbsp;<br>
network is protected by another&nbsp;<br>
firewall.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Do Firewalls provide enough Security for my Network?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The answer is a simple no. There is no such thing that a firewall is enough to&nbsp;<br>
fulfill or satisfy all your&nbsp;<br>
security concerns. Yes it does protect the trusted systems from the untrusted&nbsp;<br>
ones, but they are definitely&nbsp;<br>
not enough for all your security needs. We need to protect our systems to secure&nbsp;<br>
the company data. The&nbsp;<br>
most common methods used to break into networks are brute force password&nbsp;<br>
cracking and social&nbsp;<br>
engineering. A firewall in no way can prevent such occurrences.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are other ways in which attackers can steal or destroy company data. Phone&nbsp;<br>
Tapping and the use of&nbsp;<br>
spy gadgets has become a common occurance.Although providing safety to the&nbsp;<br>
network to a large extend, a&nbsp;<br>
firewall is still not able to protect the company data from Viruses and Trojans,&nbsp;<br>
although some firewalls do&nbsp;<br>
provide for scanning everything being downloaded, the rate at which new HTML,&nbsp;<br>
Java and other viruses are&nbsp;<br>
propping up, it is becoming very difficult for firewalls to detect all&nbsp;<br>
viruses. Anyway firewalls provide no&nbsp;<br>
physical protection to the networks. It also provides no protection from fire,&nbsp;<br>
tornados etc.Yet another&nbsp;<br>
shortcoming is the fact that if the attacker is able to break into a trusted&nbsp;<br>
system which is provided access by&nbsp;<br>
the firewall, then he can easily gain access to the data at your network, as the&nbsp;<br>
firewall will think that he is&nbsp;<br>
actually the trusted party.&nbsp;<br>
