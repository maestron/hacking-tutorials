<p class=MsoNormal><b>Kerberos Torn Apart By Ankit Fadia</b> <a

<p class=MsoNormal>________________________________________________________________</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now days, almost all networks have firewalls installed to
protect them from the dangers of the un-trusted outside world of the Internet.
When firewalls first came to the scene, they were nowhere near good enough to
protect the Network completely. However, with the passage of time, the quality
of firewalls has increased to such a level that the present day firewall
systems make the internal trusted network almost 100% safe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They can easily be configured to allow only certain kinds of
data to pass through and even can be used to set which ports can be accessed
from the un-trusted network (Internet) and which ports are accessible from the
internal trusted network. Some good ones also scan all attachments going in and
out for viruses and ensure that no confidential data is going out of the company.
The present day firewalls have really made life quite easier for the system
administrating by giving more than a little protection from the Outside world.
However, one area where the firewalls falter is if the attach is from within
the trusted internal network or in other words, the attacker is doing something
wrong, something which he is not supposed to do from within the network and not
through the Internet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Say for example, you have a well configured; firewall
installed at your company’s main server and it scans all incoming email
attachments for viruses. Now, if you get a virus attach from outside the
internal trusted network and though the Internet, then normally the firewall
will either delete or warn you about it. However, if the virus coder, is
working for you and is within the internal trusted network, then a firewall
would not be able to do anything about it and the virus will spread quite
easily. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NOTE: The above is just an example taken to ensure that you
understand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, now, I hope you realize that only a Firewall is not
sufficient for a network and it also requires something for attacks from
internal systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is where the Kerberos comes in. Kerberos is a network
authentication protocol, which provides for the verification of identities
within a heterogeneous distributed networked environment. It is the de facto
standard for authentication, which gets it name from the three-headed dog in
Greek Mythology. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For complete reference and details about Kerberos
authentication protocol, refer to the RFC 1510</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, within an internal network, the greatest danger lies in
the fact that anyone can easily pick up or sniff out confidential data like
company plans, passwords and even credit card numbers while this data is being
transferred from one system to another within the same network. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us take an example, to understand better. Say, you are
on a client, which is connected to the main server, which provides services to
all clients connected to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, when
you connect to the server to check your mail, then your email client sends your
Username and Password to the internal network server, so that you can be
authenticated. You may say that this is pretty much safe and how can it
possible harm me? Well, you are wrong. Now, when your machine sends your
Username and Password to the server, then this information does not reach the
destination server directly. The data has to pass through other machines and
sometimes if your network is large, then even through other servers before it
reaches the destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, anyone
having access to those systems through which your data passes through, can
easily sniff out your data and in this case can find out your Username and
Password, using which he can check your mail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To solve all the above problems (and many more) there is the
Kerberos. The Kerberos not only ensures that no one sniffs data out, but also
ensures the integrity of the client and server to prevent impersonation. This
basically means that it ensures that no one can fool the server into thinking
that it is some other system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, to understand how exactly, Kerberos proves to be as
good as it is, let us learn how the Kerberos protocol works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most popular Network Authentication providing software,
Kerberos is constituted of 3 main parts or sections-:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;

</span><![endif]>The Authentication Server or AS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]>2.)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>The Ticket Granting Server or TGS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]>3.)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>The Actual Encryption process or algorithm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a Network with Kerberos installed or enabled, the
Authentication Server or the AS acts as the head or the central unit, which
ensures the authenticity of the client and server and also prevents data
sniffing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One good thing about the Kerberos Authentication system is
that is a dual-authentication system, which means that it not allows the server
to verify the identity of the client but also vise-a-versa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Authentication Server acts as the secretary of both the
client and the server. The client and the server in order to communicate with
each other, have to have a connection with the AS. (The AS verifies identities
of both the client and the server.) Only once the AS has verified the
authenticity of both the client and the server, can they start to communicate
with each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Kerberos: The Working</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So when does Kerberos jump in? Well, as soon as you want to
login and type in your Username in the space provided. As soon as you type the
confidential information, the Kerberos sends it to the Authentication Server or
the AS. Then, the AS replies to the client with the session key and something
called the Ticket Granting Ticket. Both the session key and the Ticket Granting
ticket are encrypted by the user’s key. Now, before we go on, I think there is
need to explain certain things involved in the above process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, you must remember that the client and the
Authentication Server and the client share an encryption key, which is used to
encrypt data. This encrypted data is understandable (de-cryptable) by only the
AS and the client. This encryption key is generated from the User’s Password.
This means that, passing the User’s password through a certain predefined
formula derives this encryption key. Similarly all Servers, which provide
services to clients, share an encryption key with the AS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this system of client-AS and server-AS encryption keys
ensures that no one else can sniff the data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, we come to the Ticket Granting Ticket, which is sent
along with the session key[The session key is sent to the client by the AS, so
that the client can start to communicate with the Ticket Granting Server or
TGS.] to the client by the AS. A ticket is nothing but a certificate of
authenticity given to the client by the AS to prevent impersonation. The ticket
is readable only by the client system for which it is meant to be and the AS.
The Ticket Granting Ticket also makes the Kerberos system efficient as it
removes the need of repeating the initial process again and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, once the client receives the session key and the TG
Ticket, it derives the client’s key from the user’s password and tries to use
this generated key to decrypt the TG Ticket and the Ticket Granting Server key
or the TGS key. If the client is able to decrypt these two, then the password
is correct else wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, say you want to then, use the POP services of the mail
server to read your mail, then what happens is that, the client sends a request
to The Ticket Granting Server or TGS. The client encrypts important network
information and details about the request with the TGS key and sends this
encrypted data to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this is found to be valid, then TGS issues a ticket to
the client which contains the following-:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

</span><![endif]>Other Session Key details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An important thing to note here is that, for communication
between the client and the server to actually take place, they should share the
same key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The TGS generates two copies of this session key, one
encrypted with TGS key for the client and the other with application server
key. Using the TGS key, the client then, decrypts the session key meant for it,
and the session key for the application server is sent to the destination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the server receives the session key, and once it is
decrypted, it knows that this particular client is trying to contact it. The
server too has a procedure to ensure the authenticity of the client. It sends a
random number in plain text to the client. The client then decrypts it with the
session key (which they both have in common) and sends it back to the server.
On receiving this encrypted text, it can ensure that the client is not an
impersonator, as some other client cannot perform the same encryption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kerberos ensures that Sniffing out data is not that easy, as
transfer of all data, even the Keys, is done in encrypted form. The encryption
technique used by Kerberos is Data Encryption Algorithm or DES.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, there is still a slight hole in the Kerberos
system. You see, during the time when the Password is sent to the AS in the
first step, it travels through the Network in unencrypted form. This is one
time, when the Kerberos system can be exploited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Windows 2000 is I think the first Operating System, which
uses Kerberos as the standard authentication method. Anyway, now that you know
how exactly, the Kerberos Authentication System works, let us move on to how to
find out if your ISP is running it or not? Also, I highly recommend reading the
RFC 1510. This is for those who want even the tiniest of details about this
system.</p>

the Bring Up the Post Dial Up Screen option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, the router of your ISP to which you initially connect
to, holds the key. Almost all of you must have seen the Post Dial Up Screen,
which comes up, where you have to enter your Username and Password. Now, this
Post Dial Up Screen is actually your ISP’s router prompt. There is a secret
(Well, not exactly secret) router command, which will let you find out if your
ISP has implemented the Kerberos protocol.</p>
