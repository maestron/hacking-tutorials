THIS IS DUE TO THEGREATER FEAR OF WHAT A GOOD HACKER(SKILL WISE, NO MORAL JUDGEMENTS HERE)CAN DO NOWADAYS, THUS CAUSING ANTI-HACKER SENTIMENT IN THE MASSES.ALSO, FEW HACKERS SEEM TO ACTUALLY KNOWABOUT THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS THEY HACK,OR WHAT EQUIPMENT THEY WILL RUN INTOON THE FRONT END, OR WHAT THEY COULDDO WRONG ON A SYSTEM TO ALERT THE'HIGHER' AUTHORITIES WHO MONITOR THESYSTEM.THIS ARTICLE IS INTENDED TO TELL YOUABOUT SOME THINGS NOT TO DO, EVENBEFORE YOU GET ON THE SYSTEM.  WEWILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE NEW WAVE OFFRONT END SECURITY DEVICES THAT AREBEGINNING TO BE USED ON COMPUTERS.WE WILL ATTEMPT TO INSTILL IN YOU ASECOND IDENTITY, TO BE BROUGHT UP ATTIME OF GREAT NEED, TO PULL YOU OUTOF TROUBLE.AND, BY THE WAY, WE TAKE NO, REPEAT,NO, RESPONCIBILITY FOR WHAT WE SAY INTHIS AND THE FORTHCOMING ARTICLES.ENOUGH OF THE BULLSHIT, ON TO THE FUN:_______________________________________AFTER LOGGING ON YOUR FAVORITE BBS,YOU SEE ON THE HIGH ACCESS BOARD APHONE NUMBER!  IT SAYS IT'S A GREATSYSTEM TO "FUCK AROUND WITH!"THIS MAY BE TRUE, BUT HOW MANY OTHERPEOPLE ARE GOING TO CALL THE SAMENUMBER?  SO:  TRY TO AVOID CALLING ANUMBER GIVEN TO THE PUBLIC.  THIS ISBECAUSE THERE ARE AT LEAST EVERY OTHERUSER CALLING, AND HOW MANY OTHER BOARDSWILL THAT NUMBER SPREAD TO?IF YOU CALL A NUMBER FAR, FAR AWAY, ANDYOU PLAN ON GOING THRU AN EXTENDER ORA RE-SELLER, DON'T KEEP CALLING THESAME ACCESS NUMBER (I.E. AS YOU WOULDIF YOU HAD A HACKER RUNNING), THISLOOKS VERY SUSPICIOUS AND CAN MAKELIFE MISERABLE WHEN THE PHONE BILLCOMES IN THE MAIL.  MOST CITIES HAVEA VARIETY OF ACCESS NUMBERS ANDSERVICES, SO USE AS MANY AS YOU CAN.NEVER TRUST A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM...THE 414'S, THE ASSHOLES, WERE CAUGHTFOR THIS REASON:  WHEN ONE OF THEMCONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM, THERE WASNOTHING GOOD THERE.  THE NEXT TIME,THERE WAS A TREK GAME STUCK RIGHT INTHEIR WAY!  THEY PROCEDED TO PLAY SAIDGAME FOR TWO, SAY TWO AND A HALF HOURS,WHILE TELENET WAS TRACING THEM!  NICEJOB, DON'T YOU THINK?  IF ANYTHINGLOOKS SUSPICIOUS, DROP THE LINEIMMEDIATELY!!  AS IN, YESTERDAY!!THE POINT WE'RE TRYING TO GET ACCROSSIS:  IF YOU USE A LITTLE COMMON SENCE,YOU WON'T GET BUSTED.  LET THE LITTLEKIDS WHO AREN'T SMART ENOUGH TORECOGNIZE A TRAP GET BUSTED, IT WILLTAKE THE HEAT OFF OF THE REAL HACKERS.NOW, LET'S SAY YOU GET ON A COMPUTERSYSTEM...  IT LOOKS GREAT, CHECKSOUT, EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE.  OK, NOWIS WHEN IT GETS MORE DANGEROUS.  YOUHAVE TO KNOW THE COMPUTER SYSTEM (SEEFUTURE ISSUES OF THIS ARTICLE FOR INFOON SPECIFIC SYSTEMS) TO KNOW WHAT NOTTO DO.  BASICALLY, KEEP AWAY FROM ANYCOMMAND WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHTDELETE SOMETHING, COPY A NEW FILE INTOTHE ACCOUNT, OR WHATEVER!  ALWAYS LEAVETHE ACCOUNT IN THE SAME STATUS YOULOGGED IN WITH.  CHANGE _NOTHING_...IF IT ISN'T AN ACCOUNT WITH PRIV'S,THEN DON'T TRY ANY COMMANDS THATREQUIRE THEM!  ALL, YES ALL, SYSTEMSARE GOING TO BE KEEPING LOG FILESOF WHAT USERS ARE DOING, AND THAT WILLSHOW UP.  IT IS JUST LIKE DROPPING ATROUBLE-CARD IN AN ESS SYSTEM, AFTERSENDING THAT NICE OPERATOR A PRETTYTONE.  SPEND NO EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OFTIME ON THE ACCOUNT IN ONE STRETCH.KEEP YOUR CALLING TO THE VERY LATENIGHT IF POSSIBLE, OR DURING BUSINESSHOURS (BELIEVE IT OR NOT!).  IT SOHAPPENS THAT THERE ARE MORE USERS ONDURING BUSINESS HOURS, AND IT IS VERYDIFFICULT TO READ A LOG FILE WITH60 USERS DOING MANY COMMNDS EVERYMINUTE.  TRY TO AVOID SYSTEMS WHEREEVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER, DON'T TRYTO BLUFF.  AND ABOVE ALL:  NEVER ACTLIKE YOU OWN THE SYSTEM, OR ARE THEBEST THERE IS.  THEY ALWAYS GRAB THEPEOPLE WHO'S HEADS SWELL...THERE IS SOME VERY INTERESTING FRONTEND EQUIPMENT AROUND NOWADAYS, BUTFIRST LET'S DEFINE TERMS...BY FRONT END, WE MEAN ANY DEVICE THATYOU MUST PASS THRU TO GET AT THE REALCOMPUTER.  THERE ARE DEVICES THAT AREMADE TO DEFEAT HACKER PROGRAMS, ANDJUST PLAIN OLD MULTIPLEXERS.TO DEFEAT HACKER PROGRAMS, THERE ARENOW DEVICES THAT PICK UP THE PHONEAND JUST SIT THERE...  THIS MEANSTHAT YOUR DEVICE GETS NO CARRIER, THUSYOU THINK THERE ISN'T A COMPUTER ONTHE OTHER END.  THE ONLY WAY AROUND ITIS TO DETECT WHEN IT WAS PICKED UP.  IFIT PICKES UP AFTER THE SAME NUMBERRING, THEN YOU KNOW IT IS A HACKER-DEFEATER.  THESE DEVICES TAKE A MULTI-DIGIT CODE TO LET YOU INTO THE SYSTEM.SOME ARE, IN FACT, QUITE SOPHISTICATEDTO THE POINT WHERE IT WILL ALSO LIMITTHE USER NAME'S DOWN, SO ONLY ONE NAMEOR SET OF NAMES CAN BE VALID LOGINSAFTER THEY INPUT THE CODE...OTHER DEVICES INPUT A NUMBER CODE, ANDTHEN THEY DIAL BACK A PRE-PROGRAMMEDNUMBER FOR THAT CODE.  THESE SYSTEMSARE BEST TO LEAVE ALONE, BECAUSE THEYKNOW SOMEONE IS PLAYING WITH THEIRPHONE.  YOU MAY THINK "BUT I'LL JUSTREPROGRAM THE DIAL-BACK."  THINKAGAIN, HOW STUPID THAT IS...  THENTHEY HAVE YOUR NUMBER, OR A TEST LOOPIF YOU WERE JUST A LITTLE SMARTER.IF IT'S YOUR NUMBER, THEY HAVE YOURBALLS (IF MALE...), IF ITS A LOOP,THEN YOU ARE SCREWED AGAIN, SINCE THOSELOOPS ARE _MONITORED_.AS FOR MULTIPLEXERS...  WHAT A PLEXERIS SUPPOSED TO DO IS THIS:  THE SYSTEMCAN ACCEPT MULTIPLE USERS.  WE HAVETO TIME SHARE, SO WE'LL LET THE FRONT-END PROCESSOR DO IT...  WELL, THIS ISWHAT A MULTIPLEXER DOES.  USUALLY THEYWILL ASK FOR SOMETHING LIKE "ENTERCLASS" OR "LINE:".  USUALLY IT ISPROGRAMMED FOR A DOUBLE DIGIT NUMBER,OR A FOUR TO FIVE LETTER WORD.  THEREARE USUALLY A FEW SETS OF NUMBERS ITACCEPTS, BUT THOSE NUMBERS ALSO SETYOUR 300/1200 BAUD DATA TYPE.  THESEMULTIPLEXERS ARE INCONVENIENT AT BEST,SO NOT TO WORRY.A LITTLE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF HACKING:HACKING, BY OUR DEFINITION, MEANS AGREAT KNOWLEDGE OF SOME SPECIAL AREA.DOCTORS AND LAWYERS ARE HACKERS OF ASORT, BY THIS DEFINITION.  BUT MOSTOFTEN, IT IS BEING USED IN THE COMPUTERCONTEXT, AND THUS WE HAVE A DEFINITIONOF "ANYONE WHO HAS A GREAT AMOUNT OFCOMPUTER OR TELECOMMUNICATIONSKNOWLEDGE."  YOU ARE NOT A HACKERBECAUSE YOU HAVE A LIST OF CODES...HACKING, BY OUR DEFINITION, HAS THENBEEN AROUND ONLY ABOUT 15 YEARS.  ITSTARTED, WHERE ELSE BUT, MIT ANDCOLLEGES WHERE THEY HAD COMPUTERSCIENCE OR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERINGDEPARTMENTS.  HACKERS HAVE CREATEDSOME OF THE BEST COMPUTER LANGUAGES,THE MOST AWESOME OPERATING SYSTEMS, ANDEVEN GONE ON TO MAKE MILLIONS.  HACKINGUSED TO HAVE A GOOD NAME, WHEN WE COULDHONESTLY SAY "WE KNOW WHAT WE AREDOING".  NOW IT MEANS (IN THE PUBLICEYE):  THE 414'S, RON AUSTIN, THE NASAHACKERS, THE ARPANET HACKERS...  ALLTHE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT, HAVEDONE DAMAGE, AND ARE NOW GOING TO HAVETO FACE FINES AND SENTANCES.THUS WE COME PAST THE MORALISTIC CRAP,AND TO OUR PURPOSE:  EDUCATE THE HACKERCOMMUNITY, RETURN TO THE DAYS WHENPEOPLE ACTUALLY KNEW SOMETHING..._______________________________________A PROGRAM GUIDE:THREE MORE ARTICLES WILL BE WRITTEN INTHIS SERIES, AT THE PRESENT TIME.BASICS OF HACKING I:  DEC'SBASICS OF HACKING II:  VAX'S (UNIX)BASICS OF HACKING III:  DATA GENERALIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRITE AN ARTICLEON IBM, SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY SYSTEMSAND WE ONLY HAVE INFO ON A FEW..._______________________________________THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY:THE KNIGHTS OF SHADOW_______________________________________   THE BASICS OF HACKING II: VAX'S                             UNIX    UNIX IS A TRADEMARK OF AT&T    (AND YOU KNOW WHAT _THAT_ MEANS)Uploaded by Elric of Imrryr_______________________________________WELCOME TO THE BASICS OF HACKING II:VAX'S AND UNIX.  IN THIS ARTICLE, WEDISCUSS THE UNIX SYSTEM THAT RUNS ONTHE VARIOUS VAX SYSTEMS.  IF YOU AREON ANOTHER UNIX-TYPE SYSTEM, SOMECOMMANDS MAY DIFFER, BUT SINCE IT ISLICENCED TO BELL, THEY CAN'T MAKE MANYCHANGES._______________________________________HACKING ONTO A UNIX SYSTEM IS VERYDIFFICULT, AND IN THIS CASE, WE ADVISEHAVING AN INSIDE SOURCE, IF POSSIBLE.THE REASON IT IS DIFFICULT TO HACK AVAX IS THIS:  MANY VAX, AFTER YOU GETA CARRIER FROM THEM, RESPOND=>LOGIN:THEY GIVE YOU NO CHANCE TO SEE WHAT THELOGIN NAME FORMAT IS.  MOST COMMONLYUSED ARE SINGLE WORDS, UNDER 8 DIGITS,USUALLY THE PERSON'S NAME.  THERE ISA WAY AROUND THIS:  MOST VAX HAVE ANACCT. CALLED 'SUGGEST' FOR PEOPLE TOUSE TO MAKE A SUGGESTION TO THE SYSTEMROOT TERMINAL.  THIS IS USUALLY WATCHEDBY THE SYSTEM OPERATOR, BUT AT LATEHE IS PROBABLY AT HOME SLEEPING ORSCREWING SOMEONE'S BRAINS OUT.  SO WECAN WRITE A PROGRAM TO SEND AT THEVAX THIS TYPE OF A MESSAGE:A SCREEN FREEZE (CNTRL-S), SCREENCLEAR (SYSTEM DEPENDANT), ABOUT 255GARBAGE CHARACTERS, AND THEN A COMMANDTO CREATE A LOGIN ACCT., AFTER WHICHYOU CLEAR THE SCREEN AGAIN, THEN UN-FREEZE THE TERMINAL.  WHAT THIS DOES:WHEN THE TERMINAL IS FROZEN, IT KEEPSA BUFFER OF WHAT IS SENT.  WELL, THEBUFFER IS ABOUT 127 CHARACTERS LONG.SO YOU OVERFLOW IT WITH TRASH, AND THENYOU SEND A COMMAND LINE TO CREATE ANACCT. (SYSTEM DEPENDANT).  AFTER THISYOU CLEAR THE BUFFER AND SCREEN AGAIN,THEN UNFREEZE THE TERMINAL.  THIS ISA BAD WAY TO DO IT, AND IT IS MUCHNICER IF YOU JUST SEND A COMMAND TOTHE TERMINAL TO SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN,OR WHATEVER YOU ARE AFTER...THERE IS ALWAYS, *ALWAYS* AN ACCT.CALLED ROOT, THE MOST POWERFUL ACCT.TO BE ON, SINCE IT HAS ALL OF THESYSTEM FILES ON IT.  IF YOU HACK YOURWAY ONTO THIS ONE, THEN EVERYTHING ISEASY FROM HERE ON...ON THE UNIX SYSTEM, THE ABORT KEY ISTHE CNTRL-D KEY.  WATCH HOW MANY TIMESYOU HIT THIS, SINCE IT IS ALSO A WAY TOLOG OFF THE SYSTEM!A LITTLE ABOUT UNIX ARCHITECHTURE:THE ROOT DIRECTORY, CALLED ROOT, ISWHERE THE SYSTEM RESIDES.  AFTER THISCOME A FEW 'SUB' ROOT DIRECTORIES,USUALLY TO GROUP THINGS (STATS HERE,PRIV STUFF HERE, THE USER LOG HERE...).UNDER THIS COMES THE SUPERUSER (THEOPERATOR OF THE SYSTEM), AND THENFINALLY THE NORMAL USERS.  IN THE UNIX'SHELL' EVERYTHING IS TREATED THE SAME.BY THIS WE MEAN:  YOU CAN ACCESS APROGRAM THE SAME WAY YOU ACCESS A USERDIRECTORY, AND SO ON.  THE WAY THE UNIXSYSTEM WAS WRITTEN, EVERYTHING, USERSINCLUDED, ARE JUST PROGRAMS BELONGINGTO THE ROOT DIRECTORY.  THOSE OF YOUWHO HACKED ONTO THE ROOT, SMILE, SINCEYOU CAN SCREW EVERYTHING...THE MAIN LEVEL (EXEC LEVEL) PROMPT ONTHE UNIX SYSTEM IS THE $, AND IF YOUARE ON THE ROOT, YOU HAVE A # (SUPER-USER PROMPT).OK, A FEW BASICS FOR THE SYSTEM...TO SEE WHERE YOU ARE, AND WHAT PATHSARE ACTIVE IN REGUARDS TO YOUR USERACCOUNT, THEN TYPE => PWDTHIS SHOWS YOUR ACCT. SEPERATED BYA SLASH WITH ANOTHER PATHNAME (ACCT.),POSSIBLY MANY TIMES.TO CONNECT THROUGH TO ANOTHER PATH,OR MANY PATHS, YOU WOULD TYPE:YOU=> PATH1/PATH2/PATH3AND THEN YOU ARE CONNECTED ALL THEWAY FROM PATH1 TO PATH3.  YOU CANRUN THE PROGRAMS ON ALL THE PATHSYOU ARE CONNECTED TO.  IF IT DOESNOT ALLOW YOU TO CONNECT TO A PATH,THEN YOU HAVE INSUFFICIENT PRIVS, ORTHE PATH IS CLOSED AND ARCHIVED ONTOTAPE.  YOU CAN RUN PROGRAMS THIS WAYALSO:YOU=> PATH1/PATH2/PATH3/PROGRAM-NAMEUNIX TREATS EVERYTHING AS A PROGRAM,AND THUS THERE A FEW COMMANDS TOLEARN...TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IN THEEND PATH, TYPE=>  LSFOR LIST.  THIS SHOW THE PROGRAMSYOU CAN RUN.  YOU CAN CONNECT TOTHE ROOT DIRECTORY AND RUN IT'SPROGRAMS WITH=>/ROOTBY THE WAY, MOST UNIX SYSTEMS HAVETHEIR LOG FILE ON THE ROOT, SO YOUCAN SET UP A WATCH ON THE FILE, WAITINGFOR PEOPLE TO LOG IN AND SNATCH THEIRPASSWORD AS IT PASSES THRU THE FILE.TO CONNECT TO A DIRECTORY, USE THECOMMAND:  => CD PATHNAMETHIS ALLOWS YOU TO DO WHAT YOU WANTWITH THAT DIRECTORY.  YOU MAY BE ASKEDFOR A PASSWORD, BUT THIS IS A GOODWAY OF FINDING OTHER USER NAMES TOHACK ONTO.THE WILDCARD CHARACTER IN UNIX, IFYOU WANT TO SEARCH DOWN A PATH FORA GAME OR SUCH, IS THE *.=> LS /*SHOULD SHOW YOU WHAT YOU CAN ACCESS.THE FILE TYPES ARE THE SAME AS THEYARE ON A DEC, SO REFER TO THAT SECTIONWHEN EXAMINING FILE.  TO SEE WHAT ISIN A FILE, USE THE => PR FILENAMECOMMAND, FOR PRINT FILE.WE ADVISE PLAYING WITH PATHNAMES TOGET THE HANG OF THE CONCEPT.  THEREIS ON-LINE HELP AVAILABLE ON MOSTSYSTEMS WITH A 'HELP' OR A '?'.WE ADVISE YOU LOOK THRU THE HELPFILES AND PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHINGTHEY GIVE YOU ON PATHNAMES, OR THECOMMANDS FOR THE SYSTEM.YOU CAN, AS A USER, CREATE OR DESTROYDIRECTORIES ON THE TREE BENEATH YOU.THIS MEANS THAT ROOT CAN KILL EVERY-THING BUT ROOT, AND YOU CAN KILL ANYTHAT ARE BELOW YOU.

SO IT CAN SAY => SUTHIS NOW GIVES YOU THE # PROMPT, ANDALLOWS YOU TO COMPLETELY BY-PASS THEPROTECTION.  THE WONDERFUL SECURITYCONSCIOUS DEVELOPERS AT BELL MADE ITVERY DIFFICULT TO DO MUCH WITHOUTPRIVS, BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THEM, THEREIS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING STOPPING YOUFROM DOING ANYTHING YOU WANT TO.TO BRING DOWN A UNIX SYSTEM:=> CHDIR /BIN=> RM *THIS WIPES OUT THE PATHNAME BIN, WHEREALL THE SYSTEM MAINTENANCE FILES ARE.OR TRY:=> R -RTHIS RECURSIVELY REMOVES EVERYTHINGFROM THE SYSTEM EXCEPT THE REMOVECOMMAND ITSELF.OR TRY:=> KILL -1,1=> SYNCTHIS WIPES OUT THE SYSTEM DEVICES FROMOPERATION.WHEN YOU ARE FINALLY SICK AND TIREDFROM HACKING ON THE VAX SYSTEMS, JUSTHIT YOUR CNTRL-D AND REPEAT KEY, ANDYOU WILL EVENTUALLY BE LOGGED OUT._______________________________________THE REASON THIS FILE SEEMS TO BE VERYSKETCHY IS THE FACT THAT BELL HAS 7LICENCED VERSIONS OF UNIX OUT IN THEPUBLIC DOMAIN, AND THESE COMMANDS ARETHOSE COMMON TO ALL OF THEM.  WERECOMMEND YOU HACK ONTO THE ROOT ORBIN DIRECTORY, SINCE THEY HAVE THEHIGHEST LEVELS OF PRIVS, AND THEREIS REALLY NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO (EXCEPTDEVELOPE SOFTWARE) WITHOUT THEM._______________________________________THIS ARTICLE WRITTEN BY:THE KNIGHTS OF SHADOW_______________________________________Description: Hacking DEC's (Knights of Shadow II)  File Date: 6-21-87  File Time: 6:31 am********************************************************************************                                   ****       Hacking  :  DEC's           ****                                   ********************************************************************************   Welcome to Basics of Hacking I: DEC's In this article you will learn howto log in to DEC's, logging out, and all the fun stuff to do in-between.All of this information is based on a standard DEC system.  Since thereare DEC systems 10 and 20, and we favor, the DEC 20, there will be moreinfo on them in this article.  It is also the more common of the two,and is used by much more interesting people (if you know what we mean...)Ok, the first thing you want to do when you are receiving carrier froma DEC system is to find out the format of login names.  You can do thisby looking at who is on the system.DEC=> @   (the 'exec' level prompt)YOU=> SYSY is short for SY(STAT) and shows you the system status.  You should see|he format of login names... A SYSTAT usually comes up in this form:Job  Line  Program  UserJob:     The JOB number (Not important unless you want to log them off later)Line:    What line they are on (used to talk to them...)         These are both two or three digit numbers.Program: What program are they running under?  If it says 'EXEC' they aren't         doing anything at all...User:    ahhhAHHHH!  This is the user name they are logged in under...Copy the format, and hack yourself out a working code...Login format is as such:DEC=> @YOU=> login username passwordUsername is the username in the format you saw above in the SYSTAT.  After youhit the space after your username, it will stop echoing characters back toyour screen.  This is the password you are typing in...  Remember, peopleusually use their name, their dog's name, the name of a favorite characterin a book, or something like this.  A few clever people have it set to a keycluster (qwerty or asdfg).  PW's can be from 1 to 8 characters long, anythingafter that is ignored.   It would be nice to have a little help, wouldn't it?  Just type a ?or the word HELP, and it will give you a whole list of topics...Some handy characters for you to know would be the control keys, wouldn't it?Backspace on a DEC 20 is rub which is 255 on your ASCII chart.  On the DEC 10it is Ctrl-H.  To abort a long listing or a program, Ctrl-C works fine.  UseCtrl-O to stop long output to the terminal.  This is handy when playinga game, but you don't want to Ctrl-C out.  Ctrl-T for the time.  Ctrl-Uwill kill the whole line you are typing at the moment.  You may accidentlyrun a program where the only way out is a Ctrl-X, so keep that in reserve.Ctrl-S to stop listing, Ctrl-Q to continue on both systems.  Is yourterminal having trouble??  Like, it pauses for no reason, or it doesn'tbackspace right?  This is because both systems support many terminals,and you haven't told it what yours is yet...  You are using a VT05 (Isn'tthat funny?  I thought i had an apple) so you need to tell it you are one.DEC=> @YOU=> information terminal      or...YOU=> info terThis shows you what your terminal is set up as...DEC=>  all sorts of shit, then the @YOU=>  set ter vt05This sets your terminal type to VT05. Now let's see what is in the account(here after abbreviated acct.) that you have hacked onto...SAY => DIRshort for directory, it shows you what the user of the code has save to thedisk.  There should be a format like this:  xxxxx.ooo      xxxxx is the filename, from 1 to 20 characters long.  ooo is the file type, one of:exe, txt, dat, bas, cmd   and a few others that are system dependant.Exe is a compiled program that can be run (just by typing its name at the @).Txt is a text file, which you can see by typing=> type xxxxx.txtDo not try to=> type xxxxx.exe This is very bad for your terminal andwill tell you absolutly nothing. Dat is data they have saved.Bas is a basic program, you can have it typed out for you.Cmd is a command type file, a little too complicated to go into here.TRY => take xxxxx.cmdBy the way, there are other usersout there who may have files you canuse (Gee, why else am i here?).TYPE => DIR <*.*>   (DEC 20)     => DIR [*,*]   (DEC 10)* is a wildcard, and will allow youto access the files on other accounts if the user has it set for publicaccess.  If it isn't set for public access, then you won't see it.to run that program:DEC=> @YOU=> username program-nameUsername is the directory you saw the file listed under, and file name waswhat else but the file name?**  YOU ARE NOT ALONE  **Remember, you said (at the very start) SY  short for SYSTAT, and how we saidthis showed the other users on the system?  Well, you can talk to them,or at least send a message to anyone you see listed in a SYSTAT.  You cando this by:DEC=> the user list (from your systat)YOU=> talk username     (DEC 20)      send username     (DEC 10)Talk allows you and them immediate conferencing.Description: Hackign Data General (Knights of Shadow IV)  File Date: 6-21-87  File Time: 6:36 am********************************************************************************                                   ****       Hacking III: Data           ****                    General        ****                                   ********************************************************************************   Welcome to the basics of hacking III: Data General computers.Data General is favored by large corporations who need to have a lot ofdata on-line.  The Data General AOS, which stands for Advance on ofbastardized UNIX. All the commands which were in the UNIX article, willwork on a Data General.  Once again, we have the problem of not knowingthe format for the login name on the Data General you want to hack.  Asseems to be standard, try names from one to 8 digits long.  Data Generaldesigned the computer to be for businessmen, and is thus very simplistic,and basically fool proof (but not damn fool proof).  It follows the samelogin format as the unix system:DG=> login:DG=> password:YOU=> passwordPasswords can be a maximum of 8 characters, and they are almost alwaysset to a default of 'AOS' or 'DG'. (any you know about businessmen...)   A word about control characters:Ctrl-O stops massive print-outs to the screen, but leaves you in whatevermode you were.  (A technical word on what this actually does:  It tells theCPU to ignore the terminal, and prints everything out to the CPU!  This isabout 19200 baud, and so it seems like it just cancels.)  Ctrl-U kills theline you are typing at the time.  Now for the weird one:  Ctrl-C tells theCPU to stop, and wait for another ctrl character.  To stop a program,you actually need to type Ctrl-C and then a Ctrl-B.   Once you get on, type 'HELP'.  Many DG (Data General) computers are soldin a package deal, which also gets the company free customizing.  So you neverknow what commands there might be.  So we will follow what is known as the'ECLIPSE STANDARD', or''ctory like. To find out the files on the directoryyou are using, type=> DIRTo run a program, just like on a DEC, just type its name.  Other than this,and running other people's programs, there really isn't a standard...***  HARK, yon other system users  ***To see who is on, type => WHO remember?).  This shows the other users,what they are doing, and what paths they are connected across.  Thisis handy, so try a few of those paths yourself.  To send a message, say=> send usernameThis is a one time message, just like send on the DEC 10.  From here on, trycommands from the other previous files and from the 'HELP' listing.superuser:If you can get privs, just say:=> superuser onand you turn those privs on!By the way, you remember that computers keep a log of what people do?  type:=> syslog /stopand it no longer records anything you do on the system, or any of the otherusers.  It screams to high heaven that it was you who turned it off, but itkeeps no track of any accounts created or whatever else you may do.  You cansay=>  syslog /startto turn it back on (now why would you want to do something like that?????)To exit from the system, type=> BYE and the system will hang up on you.   Most of the systems around, including DECs, VAX's, and DG's, have games.These are usually located in a path or directory of the name  games or <games>or games:  Try looking in them, and you might find adventure, zork, wumpus(with bent arrows in hand) or a multitude of others. There may also begames called 'CB' or 'FORUM'. These are a sort of computer conference call.Use them on weekends, and you can meet all sorts of interesting people.   If you would like to see more articles on hacking (this time far more thanjust the basics), or maybe articles on networks and such, then leave us mailif we are on the system, or have the sysop search us down.  We call a lotof places, and you may just find us.******************************************************************************This completes the series of articles on hacking...The Basics of Hacking: IntroductionThe Basics of Hacking I: DEC'sThe Basics of Hacking II: VAX's (UNIX)The Basics of Hacking III: DG's******************************************************************************This and the previous articles by:The Knights of Shadow******************************************************************************Downloaded From P-80 International Information Systems 304-744-2253
