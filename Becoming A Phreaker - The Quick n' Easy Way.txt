Well, no fear, your obdn't servant, NightJoker is here!  ifyou've been a wannabe phreaker for years, but don't have the patienceor know-how to make some of the more advanced boxes, this is for you.This file will show how to make one of the easiest boxes, which willmake your life fun, and your enemies cringe (OK, maybe not *cringe*exactly, more like be really pissed off...).  Using readily availibleparts from your nearest Radio Shack, you too can be up there with theranks of Cap'n Crunch (well, you'd actually have to do something prettydamn daring or revoulutionary, but practice, practice, practice!).Notice the lack of ALL CAPS or an³n®oy#¶ing giÈœbbðÛeriÆsh.  This iseasy to read, easy to follow, and lots of phun.  I've done my best tomake it so that the instructions can be followed if some of the theASCII art gets fucked up in the transfer.  Just wing it.The BEIGE BoxThe beige box is the primary source of entertainment for the phreaker. With some experience, you can successfully make long distance phonecalls, obscene/prank calls, and other stuff, all on someone else'sbill. The beige box is simply a ripoff linemans handset.  You know, thebright orange ones that you see linemans holding while they cling to atelephone pole? But of course, no phreaker in their right mind is goingto climb up a pole! You're going to stay nice and safe on the ground.All this is is a normal phone with a special cable.  Simple.The construction:	Now using the minimmum of parts, you could create a basic beigebox.(1) Phone cable with the wires color-coded(1) Telephone(2) Alligator clips, green and red.It's best to use an X-Acto-style knife, or a utility knife.Now, find a phone cable (the one that goes between the wall and phone,not the handset cable).  It should be a couple feet long.  Carefullyslice it open near on plug - do it slowly, and not too deep, so thatyou dont cut any wires. Peel it open slightly, and if you see severalwires that are colored, great. If all you see is some wires that aren'tcolored, forget it, that'll be too hard (tape it up with some scotchtape, maybe your mom won't notice).Now that you've found your cable, cut off one end, a few inches fromthe connector.  Save this connector (with a few inches of cable) forlater.  Slice the covering back 3-4 inches, and cut it off, leaving thecolored wires intact. There sould be four wires - red, green, black,and yellow.  To be able to use the wire for other things later, tapethe black and yellow paralell to the cable, so they won't get into theway.  Now, strip abot a half an inch of the red and green wires.  Tostrip it, take your knife, and lay the cable on a hard table. Take thered wire, and press it to the table with your finger, about 2 inchesfrom the end.  Taking the knife, position it about a half an inch fromthe end, the point on the wire. Slowly and gently, swipe the knife AWAYfrom you, towards the end of the wire.  You should make a thin cutalong the wire. If you have not cut all the way through, do it again. Carefully separate the wire from the insulation.  You should have awire, with the end splitting into a piece of insulation and a piece ofwire.  Cut off the insulation - dont cut the wire!  Do the same thingfor the green wire.  Now, you should have a phone cable, with a connector at one end, and asripped green and red wire at the other end.Go to the nearest electronic store.  They should sell little baggies of alligator clips with colored plastic sheathes - make sure they don'thave wire attatched to them.  These cost about $1.50.  Buy (orotherwise get) a bag that has a red and green clip. Now, take your redand green clips, and slip the sheathe off of them.  They should slideright off, and leave the metal clip that has a small screw attatched toit, or a tab with a hole in it.  Unscrew the screw until there isenough space to wrap the wire around it. Wrap the properly colored wirearound it, and screw it in.  Or, stick the wire in the tab, and wrap itaround a few times, until ther is no stripped wire left.Give it alittle tug to see if it's secure.  Put the sheathe back on.  Do it tothe other wire. 	OK, you now have a phone cord, that has a plug atone end, and a redand green alligator clip, attached to the same colored wires, at theother end. 	Your're done!     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+  |     *Into Your Phone                     Attach the clips to these|  |     *                                                       ,     |  |     *                                        +++Black.......,...  |     | +-----+              /   /              +++++               ,  .  |       | +-+   |-------------/---/------------+++++++++++++++Red,,,,,,  .  |        | +-+   |-----------//--//-------------+++++++++++++++Green,,,,  .  |       | +-----+          /   /                  +++++                  .  |       |                                              +++Yellow..........  |       |                                                                .  |       |                                                                .  |       |                                 Tape these back.................  |       +-------------------------------------------------------------------+NOTE:  If you (A) can't find the right cable, or (B) are too damn lazy,Radio Shack sells cables with a standard phone connector at one end,and spade lugs connected to the colored wires at the other end.  Justcut off the connecors, and strip the wires.How to use it:How old is your house?  If it was built or if the phone system wasupgraded within the last 20 years, go to the side of the house whereyour gas and electrical meters are.  You should find the power box(where the breakers are) that wierd things with all the pipes and ameter (the gas thingie), and, maybe, a grey box with some wiresattatched to it.  Now, this might be your cable hookup, but if there'sa Bell logo on it, that's probably it.  If you can't find it, look inthe backyard.  Once you've found it, see if there is some sort of bolton it.  If it dosen't have one, reach under the box, and find the edgeof the cover.  Grab it, and pull down and out.  It should open up.  Ifit dosen't, try the sides, or the top.  If it sitll dosen't, look againfor a bolt.  If there is one, go to the handy-dandy hardware store, andget yourself a 7/16 inch hex driver.  This should open up the box. This can also be used to open up other kinds of telco switch boxes. Once you have it open, you may see several things:= Four wires, red, green, black, and yellow, hooked up to four posts bya screw.= A bunch of wires - look for the red, green, black, and yellow ones.= If you live in an apartment building, a bunch of rows of plastic,with metal tabs sticking out of them.  There should be wires coming outof most of the tabs, that are colored red, green, black, and yellow. They should be labeld with apartment numbers or phone numbers.  Lookfor yours.= One or two thick cables, connected to something else.  This is acable box, bozo.  If you want free cable, figure it out.= A shitload of spiders.  Get the RAID.Now, get a phone - the ones that are the "slimline" kind are the best,or the kind that are just a handset, and no base are better.  Plug yourmodified cable into this.  Making sure that the switch for the handsetis down, clip the red clip to the post/terminal witht the red wire. This is the RING terminal. It's usually on the right - remember thephreakers adage: ring-red-right. Connect the green clip to the greenwired post/terminal.  Make sure they are firmly attached, and nottouching any other wires.  Now, pick the phone up, and (hopefully) youshould hear a dial tone.  If not, adjust the clips (can't touch anyother posts, remember!).  If that dosen't work, then switch the clips(if that's the problem, just switch the colored insulation on theclips).    +--------------------------------------------------------------+    |             The Telephone Network Box                        |    |              +--------------------+                          |    |              |                    |                          |          |  Green ---------->x<........>x --------- Red                 |               |              |         .          |                          |               |              |         .          |                          |               |              |         ...............

That way, you can fiddle withit all you want, and not get in trouble (unless someone's on thephone). Congrats!  If it works, great!  If it dosen't, go back andcheck what you did.The Phun You Can Have:Obviously, this has to be good for something!  Remember, this isliterally and extension of their phone, keep that in mind. 	So hereis some stuff:= Make free calls.  Hopefully, the box is somewhere secluded.  Make allthe calls you want!  But, tell the person that you may have to hang upquickly.  Tell them that when this happens, they should hang up quick,too.  Don't stay on for too long!  You can get caught this way, ifsomeone tries to call alot, or someone picks up the phone and hearssomeone else having a convesation!  Be careful.= Getting someone in trouble.  Call a radio station (most have callerID).  Start cussing your brains out.  Say that everyone should worshipsatan, fuck jesus, eat SPAM, or whatever.  Hopefully, they'll track thenumber down.  Or call a bomb threat to the police.  They'll alwaystrace the call.  Perhaps, call the operator, and start fucking around. NOTE:  don't do this to someone you don't  know.  Only do it to realpricks who deserve it.  And DON'T call 911.  Their response is shittyalready, don't make it worse for some guy with a shard of glass in hisskull.= Eavesdropping.  Get a phone that has a MUTE button.  Tape it downSECURELY!  If you hold it down, the line could get noisy, and theymight get suspicious.  Record it, and blackmail 'em if it's juicy! Butbe careful, extortion is a federal offense.Some Tips:Try to look inconspicuous - don't go wearing a hot pink raincoat.  Ifgoing a night, wear dark clothes.  Keep all your stuff in a smallbackpack.  Case the place first - look to see if there's a car in thedriveway.  Are alot of lights on?  Look for the box in the obviousplaces - if you can't find it, skip it. Try to find a house that looksempty, or has alot of bushes by the box.  If you crouch, and it's dark,you might not be seen by the idle jogger or walker.  If you're reallyparanoid, wear a fake moustache.  Also, wear some kind of gloves.People are paranoid, and might get the box dusted.  (You can never betoo careful!) If someone does pick up the phone whale you are doingyour stuff, either hang up, or, for a better chance at them  not comingout, say something like "Oops, must be a crossed line."  Maybe saysomething about the phone guys doing something on the poles thismorning.  In either case, LEAVE FAST!  Don't forget to close the box,or they'll know someone was there.  And always tell the person you aretalking to that you might have to leave quick and they should hang upquick also. If you are over 21, try to look like a telco guy.  Get afishing tackle box, and but your stuff in it.  If someone hearssomething on the line, and then see's a telco guy walking away, theymight not get suspicious.  Or, if you can get a REAL telco outfit,complete with belt with all the tools, and an orange/blue/yellow hardhat with the local service logo, get real ballsy, and knock on the door and say "Hello ma'am/sir, I need to run some line tests, we've beenhaving some problems with the trunk lines, and I need to check some ofthe houses on this block.  Could you not use the phone for the nexthalf an hour?  Thanks."  Try not to piss in your pants.  Right beforeyou leave, tell them "All done here, thanks."  Remembet to spraypaintthe phone orange. Oh, and another thing, don't do it in your ownneighborhood!  Someone might see you, or there might be a nosy old guyacross the street, and he might say "Joe, I saw that kid of Marty'ssnooping around today."  Busted.  Also, be wary of "Neighborhood Watch"areas - this is full of people with binoculars and 911 on the speeddial. If someone happens to see you messing with their stuff, look asinnocent as possible.  Say something like "My friends dared me to do it- they said I was chicken unless I went to someone's house and calledthem!  Please, don't tell anyone!  My parents will KILL me! Pleaseohplease!.  Oh god, uncle Gene's gonna kill me!  Oh Jesus,please!  I was just trying to prove something to my friends!"  Maybestart to sob.  You might just get off with a lecture.  If you arewearing some sort of disguise, maybe try to make a run for it.  Ditchthe disguise, and make like nothing happend. Another thing - you maywant to buy a 10-20 foot cable, so you can connect to their phone box,and sit in the bushes a bit away, and have your phun.Advanced Stuff For The Beige Box:If you know what you are doing, here's some suggestions:= Wire a switch in line with the microphone so you can flip it in andout of the circut.  This is a helluva lot cleaner than a MUTE button,but make sure to switch it on or off before you pick up the phone, sothere won't be any abnormal noise.= If it's the kind that is just a handset, you might want to install aswitch for an on-off switch, instead of having the switch on the bottomdown.= Wire an "in-use" light into it, so that you don't pick up the phoneon someone.Remember, you are treading into illegal territory.  Don't get caught,unless you like dishing out 100,000-200,000 buckaroos and/or having"Crusher Moe" breating down your neck for 1-5 years.  And don't bragabout your phun openly - who knows, maybe Ma Bell is listening!  Bragbehind a name (like me!).DISCLAIMER I, the guy named NightJoker, do not accept any responsibilityfor any damage you, the reader, may cause.  I will not pay bail, beyour lawyer, or bake cakes with hacksaws in them.  If you get caught,you are screwed, because I can't help you.  In other words:  it ain'tmy fault!
