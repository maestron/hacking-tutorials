             Zen and the Art of Fone Phreaking `97 
 bi: CbeRpHreAk and DTMF of 4matt producti0nz

b4 i get started, just remember i did not rite this phile 
so you people can learn preform telecommunications fraud!
contrary to popular beleafs phreaking is still an art form.
phreaking is a form of intelectual advancement. is just like
hacking, if u think of it this way: when hacking you type
certain commands in phreaking, you play certain MHz tones.
blue boxing is just like gaining r00t access of a unix sys.
by gaining r00t access you be come the 'system operator'.
the blue box utelizes 'system operator' tones. see what i'm sayn? 
just cuz phreaking is intelectual it dousnt mean it cant be fun.

First switching system used in America, adopted in 1918 and until 
1978 Bell had over 53% of all exchanges using Step by Step [SxS].  
A long,and confusing train of switches is used for SxS switching.

                           Crossbar 
                           ~~~~~~~

Crossbar has been Bell's primary switcher after 1960.  Three 
types of Crossbar switching exist:  Number 1 Crossbar [1XB], 
Number 4 Crossbar [4XB], and Number 5 Crossbar [5XB].  A 
switching matrix is used for all the phones in an area.When 
someone calls, the route is determined and is met up with the 
othr fone.The matrix is set-up in horizontal and vertical paths.  
There are no definite distinguishing features of Crossbar 
switching.
 

                           ESS
                           ~~~

ESS is the big brother of the Bell family. Its very name strikes 
fear and apprehension into the hearts of most who have this
knowlege, for a good reason. ESS [electronic switching System]
knows the full story on every telephone hooked into it. While
it may be paranoid to say that all telecomunications loop holes 
may come to a screeching hault under ESS, it is certainly 
realistic to think that everyone must be a little more careful
under ESS. Heres why:

With ESS, every single digit dialed is recorded. This is useful
not only for nailing telecomunications frauders but settling
billing disputes. In the past, there has been no easy way for
the phone company to show you what numbers you have dialed locally.
If you protested long enough, and loud enough, they might have put
a pen register on your line to record everything and prove it to 
you. Under ESS, the actual printout [which will be dragged out of 
of a vault somewhere if needed] shows every last digit you dialed,
Every 800 call, every directory assistance, repair service, the
operator, every rendation of the 1812 overture, everything! Here
is a typical example of an ESS print out, which shows time of 
connect, and a number called:

      DATE   TIME   LENGTH  UNITS  NUMBER        NOTE
      ----          ----       ------          -----        ------                  ----
      0403       1517     3                1            264-9021          none
      0403       1523     5                3            576-1303          H,P,V,C,A
      0403       1600     1                0            800-555-1212   none
      0403       1612     10              2.25*     716-221-3184   none
      0403       01629   1                0            000-000-0000   O 
      [TSPS]    

Now your probally asking, "What are those letters under
"NOTE?" Well, those letters stand for cretain words or 
phrases that the Telco/phone company serches for. For 
instance: O may stand for Overthrow. From here on, every 
time you dial that number, the ESS may tap the line! And 
this IS Legal! It is legal because they may think you are 
planning to "Overthrow" the Government or something! 
You never know. 

A thousand calls to "800" will show up on the Ess print out.
Every touch tone or pulse is kept track off along with every
foreign signal. A traffic engineer did an exhausting study of 800 calls
over the past few years and came to these conclusions:

1] Legit made calls to 800 numbers last up to an average 
   of three minutes or less. Of the illegal calls via 800
   lines, more than 80% lasted 5 minutes or longer.

2] The average residential telephone subscriber dials five
   calls per month to an 800 number. Persons making illegal
   calls via 800 numbers average significantly higher number. 


Under ESS, one simply does not place a 2600 MHz on the line,
unless of course, they want a Telco security representative
and a FBI/Police man at their door with in the hour!    

Tracing calls, for reasons such as fraud or abusive calls, is done
from a computer terminal in a security department.  Within Ess,
nothing is hidden or concealed in electromechanical frames, etc.
It is merely a software program designed for ease in operation by the 
Telco.  Call tracing has become very sophisticated and immediate.
There is no more "running in the frames" or looking for long periods
of time. ROM Chips in ESS computers work quickly.  That's what ESS
is all about.

Minimizing telecommunications fraud is not the only reason for ESS,
but is a very important one.  The first and foremost reason for the
ESS is to provide the Teleco with better control on billing and
equipment records, faster handling of calls [i.e. less equipment
tied up in the office at one time], and to help agencies such as
the F.B.I. keep better account of who was calling who from where.
When the F.B.I. finds out that someone who's calls they want to trace
is on an ESS exchange, they are thrilled because it is so much easier
for them to trace.  

The United States won't be 100% ESS until sometime around 2010.
But, in real practice, phone offices in almost every city, are getting
some of the basic modifications brought about by ESS. "911" service
is an ESS function.  So is ANI [ Automatic Number Identification] on
long distance calls. "Dial Tone First" payphones are also an ESS
function.  None of these things were available prior to ESS.  The
amount of pure fraud calling via bogess calling card numbers,
third party dialing, colored boxing, etc. on the ESS lines led to
the decision to rapidly install the ANI, for example, even if the
rest of the ESS was several years away in some cases.

Depending on how you you choose to look at the whole concept of ESS,
it can be either one of the most advantageous inventions of all time,
or one of the terrifying.  The system is good for consumers in that
it can take a lot of activity and do lots of things that older
systems could never do.  Features such as direct dialing overseas,
call forwarding, and call holding are steps forward without question.
But at the same time, what do all of the nasty implications mentioned
further back mean to the average person on the sidewalk? This system
is perfectly capable of monitoring anyone , not just telecommunication
frauders. What would happen if the nice, friendly government we have
somehow got overthrown and a mean nasty one took its place?  With ESS,
they wouldn't have to do much work, just come up with some new software.
Imagine a phone system that could tell authorities how many calls you
placed to certain types of people: i.e. African Americans, Hispanics,
Communists, known Anacharists, laundromat service employees....ESS
could do it if so programmed.

_`'-.,_,.-'`_`'-.,_,.-> [ History of the Art of phreaking ] <-.,_,.-'`_`'-.,_,.-'`_

the age of blue boxing began, not with a bang, but with a whistle. In 
1972,a man named John Draper, a slightly scraggly engineer at a national
semiconductor, found a small blue whistle in a box of "Captain Crunch" 
Cereal. The whistle was deformed and had an odd extra hole. Draper found 
that when the regular hole was covered the whistle created a perfect 2600hz 
cycle. Draper, who now refers to himself as "Cap'n Crunch", toyed with the 
whistle until he created his first basic PCI-Board construction of the Blue box. 
After receiving a university file which contained information on all operator 
tones, the Cap'n created the new version of the blue box which utilizes all
operator tones.

_`'-.,_,.-'`_`'-.,_,.-> [ Colored Boxing ] <-.,_,.-'`_`'-.,_,.-'`_

The bulk of phreaking was (and still is to some extent) committed
by a technological piece known as a colored box.  Most colored boxes
function by using certain Megahurtz tones/ combinations of Megahurtz
tones . The next section gives a list and short description of all colored boxes. 

What is a Red Box?

When a coin is inserted into a payphone, the payphone emits a set of
tones to ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System).  Red boxes work by fooling
ACTS into believing you have actually put money into the phone.  The
red box simply plays the ACTS tones into the telephone microphone.
ACTS hears those tones, and allows you to place your call.  The actual
tones are:

Nickel Signal      1700+2200hz  0.060s on
Dime Signal        1700+2200hz  0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
Quarter Signal     1700+2200hz  33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating

Canada uses a variant of ACTSD called N-ACTS.  N-ACTS uses different
tones than ACTS.  In Canada, the tones to use are:

Nickel Signal      2200hz       0.060s on
Dime Signal        2200hz       0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
Quarter Signal    2200hz       33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating

How do I build a Red Box?

Red boxes are commonly manufactured from modified Radio Shack tone
dialers, Hallmark greeting cards, or made from scratch from readily
available electronic components.

To make a Red Box from a Radio Shack 43-141 or 43-146 tone dialer, open
the dialer and replace the crystal with a new one. The purpose of the
new crystal is to cause the * button on your tone dialer to create a
1700Mhz and 2200Mhz tone instead of the original 941Mhz and 1209Mhz
tones.  The exact value of the replacement crystal should be 6.466806 to
create a perfect 1700Mhz tone and 6.513698 to create a perfect 2200mhz
tone.  A crystal close to those values will create a tone that easily
falls within the loose tolerances of ACTS. The most popular choice is
the 6.5536Mhz crystal, because it is the easiest to procure.  The old
crystal is the large shiny metal component labeled "3.579545Mhz."  When
you are finished replacing the crystal, program the P1 button with five
*'s.  That will simulate a quarter tone each time you press P1.

Where can I get a 6.5536Mhz crystal?

Your best bet is a local electronics store.  Radio Shack sells them, but
they are overpriced and the store must order them in.  This takes
approximately two weeks.  In addition, many Radio Shack employees do not
know that this can be done.

Or, you could order the crystal mail order.  This introduces Shipping
and Handling charges, which are usually much greater than the price of
the crystal.  It's best to get several people together to share the S&H
cost.  Or, buy five or six yourself and sell them later.  Some of the
places you can order crystals are:

Which payphones will a Red Box work on?

Red Boxes will work on telco owned payphones, but not on COCOT's
COCOT is an acronym for Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephones.
COCOT's are the payphones that you see in front/inside of restraunts
that don't dial directly into the ESS, they first dial into the
operating phone system of the store/restraunt in which it is located. 

Red boxes work by fooling ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System) into
believing you have put money into the pay phone.  ACTS is the
telephone company software responsible for saying "Please deposit XX
cents" and listening for the coins being deposited.

COCOT's do not use ACTS.  On a COCOT, the pay phone itself is
responsible for determining what coins have been inserted.

How do I make local calls with a Red Box?

Payphones do not use ACTS for local calls.  To use your red box for
local calls, you have to fool ACTS into getting involved in the call.

One way to do this, in some areas, is by dialing 10288-xxx-xxxx.  This
makes your call a long distance call, and brings ACTS into the
picture.

In other areas, you can call Directory Assistance and ask for the
number of the person you are trying to reach.  The operator will give
you the number and then you will hear a message similar to "Your call
can be completed automatically for an additional 35 cents."  When this
happens, you can then use ACTS tones.

What is a Blue Box?

Blue boxes use a 2600hz tone to size control of telephone switches
that use in-band signaling.  The caller may then access special
switch functions, with the usual purpose of making free long distance
phone calls, using the tones provided by the Blue Box.
 
Do Blue Boxes still work?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from a message posted to Usenet by
Marauder of the Legion of Doom:

        Somewhere along the line I have seen reference to something
        similar to "Because of ESS Blue boxing is impossible".  This is
        incorrect.  When I lived in Connecticut I was able to blue box
        under Step by Step, #1AESS, and DMS-100.  The reason is simple,
        even though I was initiating my call to an 800 number from a
        different exchange (Class 5 office, aka Central Office) in each
        case, when the 800 call was routed to the toll network it would
        route through the New Haven #5 Crossbar toll Tandem office.  It
        just so happens that the trunks between the class 5 (CO's) and
        the class 4 (toll office, in this case New Haven #5 Xbar),
        utilized in-band (MF) signalling, so regardless of what I
        dialed, as long as it was an Inter-Lata call, my call would
        route through this particular set of trunks, and I could Blue
        box until I was blue in the face.  The originating Central
        Offices switch (SXS/ESS/Etc..) had little effect on my ability
        to box at all.  While the advent of ESS (and other electronic
        switches) has made the blue boxers task a bit more difficult,
        ESS is not the reason most of you are unable to blue box.  The
        main culprit is the "forward audio mute" feature of CCIS (out of
        band signalling).  Unfortunately for the boxer 99% of the Toll
        Completion centers communicate using CCIS links, This spells
        disaster for the blue boxer since most of you must dial out of
        your local area to find trunks that utilize MF signalling, you
        inevitably cross a portion of the network that is CCIS equipped,
        you find an exchange that you blow 2600hz at, you are rewarded
        with a nice "winkstart", and no matter what MF tones you send at
        it, you meet with a re-order.  This is because as soon as you
        seized the trunk (your application of 2600hz), your Originating
        Toll Office sees this as a loss of supervision at the
        destination, and Mutes any further audio from being passed to
        the destination (ie: your waiting trunk!).  You meet with a
        reorder because the waiting trunk never "hears" any of the MF
        tones you are sending, and it times out.  So for the clever
        amongst you, you must somehow get yourself to the 1000's of
        trunks out there that still utilize MF signalling but
        bypass/disable the CCIS audio mute problem.  (Hint: Take a close
        look at WATS extenders).

What is a Black Box?

A Black Box is a resistor (and often capacitor in parallel) placed in
series across your phone line to cause the phone company equipment to be
unable to detect that you have answered your telephone.  People who call
you will then not be billed for the telephone call.  Black boxes do not
work under ESS.

What do all the colored boxes do?

What is an ANAC number?

An ANAC (Automatic Number Announcement Circuit) number is a telephone
number that plays back the number of the telephone that called it. ANAC
numbers are convenient if you want to know the telephone number of a pair
of wires.

What is the ANAC number for my area?

How to find your ANAC number:

Look up your NPA (Area Code) and try the number listed for it. If that
fails, try 1 plus the number listed for it. If that fails, try the common
numbers like 311, 958 and 200-222-2222. If you find the ANAC number for
your area, please let us know.

Note that many times the ANAC number will vary for different switches insame city. The geographic naming on the list is not intended to be an
accurate reference for coverage patterns, it is for convenience only.

Many companies operate 800 number services which will read back to you the
number from which you are calling. Many of these require navigating a
series of menus to get the phone number you are looking for.

(800)238-4959   A voice mail system
(800)328-2630   A phone sex line
(800)568-3197   Info Access Telephone Company's Automated Blocking Line
(800)571-8859   A phone sex line
(800)692-6447   (800)MY-ANI-IS
(800)455-3256   Unknown

An non-800 ANAC that works nationwide is 404-988-9664. The one catch with
this number is that it must be dialed with the AT&T Carrier Access Code
10732.

Another non-800 nationwide ANAC is Glen Robert of Full Disclosure
Magazine's number, 10555-1-708-356-9646.

Please use local ANAC numbers if you can, as abuse or overuse kills 800
ANAC numbers.

What is a ringback number?

A ringback number is a number that you call that will immediately ring the
telephone from which it was called.

In most instances you must call the ringback number, quickly hang up the
phone for just a short moment and then let up on the switch, you will then
go back off hook and hear a different tone. You may then hang up. You will
be called back seconds later.

What is the ringback number for my area?

An 'x' means insert those numbers from the phone number from which you are
calling. A '?' means that the number varies from switch to switch in the
area, or changes from time to time. Try all possible combinations.

If the ringback for your NPA is not listed, try common ones such as
951-xxx-xxxx, 954, 957 and 958. Also, try using the numbers listed for
other NPA's served by your telephone company.

Note: These geographic areas are for reference purposes only. Ringback
numbers may vary from switch to switch within the same city.

What is a loop?

This FAQ answer is excerpted from: ToneLoc v0.99 User Manual by Minor
Threat & Mucho Maas

Loops are a pair of phone numbers, usually consecutive, like 836-9998 and
836-9999. They are used by the phone company for testing. What good do
loops do us? Well, they are cool in a few ways. Here is a simple use of. Each loop has two ends, a 'high' end, and a 'low' end. One end gives
a (usually) constant, loud tone when it is called. The other end is silent.
Loops don't usually ring either. When BOTH ends are called, the people that
called each end can talk through the loop. Some loops are voice filtered
and won't pass anything but a constant tone; these aren't much use to you.
Here's what you can use working loops for: billing phone calls! First, call
the end that gives the loud tone. Then if the operator or someone calls the
other end, the tone will go quiet. Act like the phone just rang and you
answered it ... say "Hello", "Allo", "Chow", "Yo", or what the fuck ever.
The operator thinks that she just called you, and that's it! Now the phone
bill will go to the loop, and your local RBOC will get the bill! Use this
technique in moderation, or the loop may go down. Loops are probably most
useful when you want to talk to someone to whom you don't want to give your
phone number.

What is a CNA number?

CNA stands for Customer Name and Address. The CNA number is a phone number
for telephone company personnel to call and get the name and address for a
phone number. If a telephone lineman finds a phone line he does not
recognize, he can use the ANI number to find it's phone number and then
call the CNA operator to see who owns it and where they live.

Normal CNA numbers are available only to telephone company personnel.
Private citizens may now legally get CNA information from private
companies. Two such companies are:

Unidirectory    (900)933-3330
Telename        (900)884-1212

Note that these are 900 numbers, and will cost you approximately one dollar
per minute.

If you are in 312 or 708, AmeriTech has a pay-for-play CNA service
available to the general public. The number is 796-9600. The cost is
$.35/call and can look up two numbers per call.

If you are in 415, Pacific Bell offers a public access CNA service at
(415)781-5271.

What is scanning?

Scanning is dialing a large number of telephone numbers in the hope of
finding interesting carriers (computers) or tones.

Scanning can be done by hand, although dialing several thousand telephone
numbers by hand is extremely boring and takes a long time.

Much better is to use a scanning program, sometimes called a war dialer or
a demon dialer. Currently, the best war dialer available to PC-DOS users is
ToneLoc from Minor Threat and Mucho Maas. ToneLoc can be FTPed from
ftp.paranoia.com.

A war dialer will dial a range of numbers and log what it finds at each
number. You can then only dial up the numbers that the war dialer marked as
carriers or tones.

Is scanning illegal?

Excerpt from: 2600, Spring 1990, Page 27:

In some places, scanning has been made illegal.  It would be hard,
though, for someone to file a complaint against you for scanning since
the whole purpose is to call every number once and only once.  It's
not likely to be thought of as harassment by anyone who gets a single
phone call from a scanning computer.  Some central offices have been
known to react strangely when people start scanning.  Sometimes you're
unable to get a dialtone for hours after you start scanning.  But
there is no uniform policy.  The best thing to do is to first find out
if you've got some crazy law saying you can't do it.  If, as is
likely, there is no such law, the only way to find out what happens is
to give it a try.

It should be noted that a law making scanning illegal was recently passed
in Colorado Springs, CO. It is now illegal to place a call in Colorado
Springs without the intent to communicate.

What are the DTMF frequencies?

DTMF stands for Dual Tone Multi Frequency. These are the tones you get when
you press a key on your telephone touchpad. The tone of the button is the
sum of the column and row tones. The ABCD keys do not exist on standard
telephones.

Notes:

[C1]     - Means code used for Cellular One service
[1]      - for cellular in Pittsburgh, PA A/C 412 in some areas
[2]      - indicates that you are not local and maybe how to reach you
[3]      - found in Pac Bell territory; Intercom ring causes a distinctive
           ring to be generated on the current line; Hold keeps a call
           connected until another extension is picked up
[4]      - applied once before each call
[5]      - A.C.R. blocks calls from those who blocked Caller ID
           (used in C&P territory, for instance)
[6]      - cancels further return attempts
[M: *xx] - alternate code used for MLVP (multi-line variety package)
           by Bellcore. It goes by different names in different RBOCs.
           In Bellsouth it is called Prestige. It is an arrangement of
           ESSEX like features for single or small multiple line groups.

           The reason for different codes for some features in MLVP is that
           call-pickup is *8 in MLVP so all *8x codes are reaasigned *5x

What is Caller-ID?

This FAQ answer is stolen from Rockwell:

Calling Number Delivery (CND), better known as Caller ID, is a telephone
service intended for residential and small business customers. It allows
the called Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to receive a calling party's
directory number and the date and time of the call during the first 4
second silent interval in the ringing cycle.

Parameters

The data signalling interface has the following characteristics:

        Link Type:                              2-wire, simplex
        Transmission Scheme:            Analog, phase-coherent FSK
        Logical 1 (mark)                        1200 +/- 12 Hz
        Logical 0 (space)                       2200 +/- 22 Hz
        Transmission Rate:                      1200 bps
        Transmission Level:                     13.5 +/- dBm into 900 ohm load

Protocol

The protocol uses 8-bit data words (bytes), each bounded by a start bit and
a stop bit. The CND message uses the Single Data Message format shown
below.

| Channel  |  Carrier   |  Message  |  Message  |  Data          | Checksum |
| Seizure    |  Signal   |  Type          |  Length     |  Word(s)    | Word         |
| Signal      |                |  Word         |  Word       |                     |                    |

Channel Siezure Signal

The channel seizure is 30 continuous bytes of 55h (01010101) providing a
detectable alternating function to the CPE (i.e. the modem data pump).

Carrier Signal

The carrier signal consists of 130 +/- 25 mS of mark (1200 Hz) to condition
the receiver for data.

Message Type Word

The message type word indicates the service and capability associated with
the data message. The message type word for CND is 04h (00000100).

Message Length Word

The message length word specifies the total number of data words to follow.

Data Words

The data words are encoded in ASCII and represent the following
information:

   * The first two words represent the month
   * The next two words represent the day of the month
   * The next two words represent the hour in local military time
   * The next two words represent the minute after the hour
   * The calling party's directory number is represented by the remaining
     words in the data word field

If the calling party's directory number is not available to the terminating
central office, the data word field contains an ASCII "O". If the calling
party invokes the privacy capability, the data word field contains an ASCII
"P".

Checksum Word

The Checksum Word contains the twos complement of the modulo 256 sum of the
other words in the data message (i.e., message type, message length, and
data words). The receiving equipment may calculate the modulo 256 sum of
the received words and add this sum to the reveived checksum word. A result
of zero generally indicates that the message was correctly received.
Message retransmission is not supported.

Example CNS Single Data Message

An example of a received CND message, beginning with the message type word,
follows:

04 12 30 39 33 30 31 32 32 34 36 30 39 35 35 35 31 32 31 32 51

04h=  Calling number delivery information code (message type word)
12h=  18 decimal; Number of data words (date,time, and directory
      number words)
ASCII 30,39= 09; September
ASCII 33,30= 30; 30th day
ASCII 31,32= 12; 12:00 PM
ASCII 32,34= 24; 24 minutes (i.e., 12:24 PM)
ASCII 36,30,39,35,35,35,31,32,31,32= (609) 555-1212; calling
      party's directory number
51h=  Checksum Word

Data Access Arrangement (DAA) Requirements

To receive CND information, the modem monitors the phone line between the
first and second ring bursts without causing the DAA to go off hook in the
conventional sense, which would inhibit the transmission of CND by the
local central office. A simple modification to an existing DAA circuit
easily accomplishes the task.

Modem Requirements

Although the data signalling interface parameters match those of a Bell 202
modem, the receiving CPE need not be a Bell 202 modem. A V.23 1200 bps
modem receiver may be used to demodulate the Bell 202 signal. The ring
indicate bit (RI) may be used on a modem to indicate when to monitor the
phone line for CND information. After the RI bit sets, indicating the first
ring burst, the host waits for the RI bit to reset. The host then
configures the modem to monitor the phone line for CND information.

Signalling

According to Bellcore specifications, CND signalling starts as early as 300
mS after the first ring burst and ends at least 475 mS before the second
ring burst

Applications

Once CND information is received the user may process the information in a
number of ways.

  1. The date, time, and calling party's directory number can be displayed.
  2. Using a look-up table, the calling party's directory number can be
     correlated with his or her name and the name displayed.
  3. CND information can also be used in additional ways such as for:
       1. Bulletin board applications
       2. Black-listing applications
       3. Keeping logs of system user calls, or
       4. Implementing a telemarketing data base

How do I block Caller-ID?

Always test as much as possible before relying on any method of blocking
Caller-ID. Some of these methods work in some areas, but not in others.

Dial *67 before you dial the number.  (141 in the United Kingdom)
Dial your local TelCo and have them add Caller-ID block to your line.
Dial the 0 Operator and have him or her place the call for you.
Dial the call using a pre-paid phone card.
Dial through Security Consultants at (900)PREVENT for U.S. calls
     ($1.99/minute) or (900)STONEWALL for international calls ($3.99/minute).
Dial from a pay phone.  :-)

What is a PBX?

A PBX is a Private Branch Exchange. A PBX is a small telephone switch owned
by a company or organization. Let's say your company has a thousand
employees. Without a PBX, you would need a thousand phone lines. However,
only 10% of your employees are talking on the phone at one time. What if
you had a computer that automatically found an outside line every time one
of your employees picked up the telephone. With this type of system, you
could get by with only paying for one hundred phone lines. This is a PBX.

What is a VMB?

A VMB is a Voice Mail Box. A VMB is a computer that acts as an answering
machine for hundreds or thousands of users. Each user will have their own
Voice Mail Box on the system. Each mail box will have a box number and a
pass code.

Without a passcode, you will usually be able to leave messages to users on
the VMB system. With a passcode, you can read messages and administer a
mailbox. Often, mailboxes will exist that were created by default or are no
longer used. These mailboxes may be taken over by guessing their passcode.
Often the passcode will be the mailbox number or a common number such as
1234.

What are the ABCD tones for?

The ABCD tones are simply additional DTFM tones that may be used in any way
the standard (0-9) tones are used. The ABCD tones are used in the U.S.
military telephone network (AutoVon), in some Automatic Call Distributor
(ACD) systems, for control messages in some PBX systems, and in some
amateur radio auto-patches.

In the AutoVon network, special telephones are equipped with ABCD keys. The
ABCD keys are defined as such:

A - Flash
B - Flash override priority
C - Priority communication
D - Priority override

Using a built-in maintenance mode of the Automatic Call Distributor (ACD)
systems once used by Directory Assistance operators, you could connect two
callers together.

The purpose of the Silver Box is to create the ABCD tones.


_`'-.,_,.-'`_`'-.,_,.-> [ DTMF's phucking with the operators ] <-.,_,.-'`_`'-.,_,.-'`_

           Ever get an operator who gave you a hard time, cuz u kept calling
back talking, asking dumb questionz, or cussig at her and you didn't no
what to du? Well if the operator hears you use a little Bell jargon, she might
wise up. Here is a little diagram (excuse the artwork) of the structure of
operators

/-----------\         /------\         /------\
!Operator!-- > ! S.A. ! --->! BOS !
\-----------/         \------/         \------/
   !
   !
   V
/-----------------\
! Group Chief !
\-----------------/

    Now most of the operators are not bugged, so they can curse at you, if they
do ask INSTANTLY for the "S.A." or the Service Assistant. The operator does not
report to her (95% of them are hers) but they will solve most of your problems.
She MUST give you her name as she connects & all of these calls are bugged. If
the SA gives you a rough time get her BOS (Business Office Supervisor) on the
line. S/He will almost always back her girls up, but sometimes the SA will get
tarred and feathered. The operator reports to the Group Chief, and S/He will
solve 100% of your problems, but the chances of getting S/He on the line are
nill.
    If a lineman (the guy who works out on the poles) or an installation man
gives you the works ask to speak to the Installation Foreman, that works
wonders.
    Here is some other bell jargon, that might come in handy if you are having
trouble with the line. Or they can be used to lie your way out of
situations....

     An Erling is a line busy for 1 hour, used mostly in traffic studies A
Permanent Signal is that terrible howling you get if you disconnect, but don't
hang up.
     Everyone knows what a busy signal is, but some idiots think that is the
*Actual* ringing of the phone, when it just is a tone "beeps" when the phone is
ringing, wouldn't bet on this though, it can (and does) get out of sync.
     When you get a busy signal that is 2 times as fast as the normal one, the
person you are trying to reach isn't really on the phone, (he might be), it is
actually the signal that a trunk line somewhere is busy and they haven't or
can't reroute your call. Sometimes you will get a Recording, or if you get
nothing at all (Left High & Dry in fone terms) all the recordings are being
used and the system is really overused, will probably go down in a little
while. This happened when the bomb went off @ the olimpix, the system just 
couldn't handle the calls. By the way this is called the "reorder signal" 
and the trunk line iz "blocked".
     One more thing, if an overseas call isn't completed and doesn't generate
any money for AT&T, is is called an "Air & Water Call".
