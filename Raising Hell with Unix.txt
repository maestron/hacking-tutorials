However, all levels of hackers should benefit in some way from the information contained within. And now... on with our show...II - How To Fill a Hard Disk    There are several ways to cause havoc by filling up a systems harddisk. Filling up a hard disk will make it so that the system cannot createthe temporary files vital to it's efficient use. It will also cause otherproblems, such as a person trying to save a 10 page financial report, andfinding that there is no room for it. Also, if the HD is full, the systemwill not run properly. You will be bombarded by a continuous stream of'write failed, file system is full'. Over all, this is a very good way to piss people off.    Step One    Create the following file with the 'ed [filename]' utility under thebourne shell, or the 'edit [filename]' under the C shell. The filename can be whatever you want, here I will call it 'hah1'. Only type in what is contained within '[]'s, the other text is what the system will send toyou.$[ed hah1]0*[a][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][echo Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!! >> -fucku!][nohup hah1 &][^C]*[w]754*[q]$[chmod +r+w+x hah1]$[nohup hah1 &]1234$  This will create a file called '-fucku!'. Files beginning with a '-' are very difficult to delete, as when you try to do a 'rm -fucku!'<rm - remove file> It interprets the '-f' as an option, it tries thento force delete the file 'ucku!'. As you can imagine.... this wouldn'tquite work. The text after the echo can be anything you wish, I justused a sample text that is quite pointless and takes up space. The numbersrepresent the file size, and process number,  they will be different on your system.  The file will add the text from the echo statement to the file '-fucku!'until it reaches the 'hah1 &' command, which will make it start over again.This is an endless loop. For as long as you are on-line, and their are processes left, the file will continue to add to the file. This is avery slow method, but it's easy if you are starting from scratch. Ifyou get a message such as 'cannot fork hah1: process terminated' that meansthat the loop is taking up so much memory that the system can no longercontinue with that job. Don't worry, it will settle back to normal after allthe processes are eventually killed, if it does, continue to run the filein the background until you have a '-fucku!' file that is about 100-200klong, this will allow us to progress to our next step.  The command 'nohup hah1 &' tells unix to continue to run the 'hah1'in the background, even after you hangup. This means you can run the program, hang up, and call back. This function will only work under the bourne shell. If you have a prompt of '$', then you are using thebourne shell. This function will become exceedingly useful when westart with the next step.  The command 'chmod +r+w+x hah1' will make the file readable, writable, andexecutable by you. This string may or may not be necessary on the system youare using. If you get a message such as 'hah1: Permission Denied' than youwill need to use the chmod command. And now onto the next step...     Step Two    We will now explore the ever powerful 'cat' command. The 'cat' commandis the equivalent of the MS-DOS 'type' command. We will use a functionof the unix system called redirection that will allow us to 'cat' filesinto each other. This will cause the source file to be copied to the endof the destination file, I'm sure you're beginning to see the mischiefyou can cause with this.     To begin with, create a file called '-fucku2' the same way you createdthe '-fucku!' file. Try to run the 'hah1' program until the new 'fucku2' file is around 100-200k also. This isn't absolutely necessary, but it's helpful and saves some time.    Next, create the following file with the editor <'ed' or 'edit'>. I will call it 'hah2', but you may call it whatever you wish.$[ed hah2]0*[a][cat -fucku! >> -fucku2][cat -fucku2 >> -fucku!][nohup hah2 &][^C]*[w]61*[q]$[chmod +r+w+x hah2]$[nohup hah2 &]7049$  What we've just done is create a very short, and very nasty, program that can fill 20 megs in under 5 minutes. The file when run will add the contents of '-fucku!' to the end of '-fucku2', and do the reverse. This means that when you have two files of 100k to begin with, you will get the following results after every completed loop...-fucku!  ..  -fucku2  ..  -fucku!  ..  -fucku2  100k    >>   200k    >>    300k   >>    500k 700k    >>   1200k   >>    1900k  >>    3100k  As you can see, the file grows VERY quickly. Set it up in the morningbefore school, come back and the HD should be completely full. You maywish to also run multiple write processes, just to confuse the system.If you do, rename the files to something appropriate, but maintain thebase content. If you do it in several directories, the sysop will haveto do some serious cleaning to get rid of it.    Step Three    Sit back and laugh. If you wait awhile, in approximately 30 minutes,the average 40 meg hard drive will be full. I've tested this method onseveral systems, even an ancient VAX, and the results were more or lessthe same. The sysop, or any other user, will be able to write anythingonto the system until this problem is resolved. Many programs needto create temporary files to even operate. These programs are now completely unusable, except for the few that save to memory. To deletethe files, the sysop will have to do one of several things, all of whichare very unpleasant. And now for the next lesson...III - Mischief  This section will describe a couple of ways of perpetrating mischief on aunix system. These ideas are for the most part harmless, but can definitelypiss people off. The idea of a continuous subdir was molded from onepresented by Shooting Shark.   Idea #1     This method will create an endless amount of directories under a the current directory. Create multiple files with different name and directories to really annoy the 'sop. Type the following to accomplish this.$[ed sub1]0*[a][mkdir -FuCkU!1][chdir -FuCkU!1][/xxx/xxx/sub1 &][^C]*[w]69*[q]$[chmod +r+w+x sub1]$[nohup sub1 &]7099$  This program will create a directory called '-FuCkU!1', change to thatdirectory, then create another one under the first one, and so forth. Itis an endless loop, and will continue virtually forever. The third lineof the program contains a string '/xxx/xxx/sub1 &'. You will need to fillin the x's with your current directory. To find out your current directory type 'pwd' this will print a string telling which directory you are in.Fill in the x's with this data. The rest of the program you should be ableto figure out by now. Try it, you'll like it.           Idea #2     So, you've seen someone on the system that you really don't like? Or doyou just want to piss someone off? This methods for you. This method willdescribe a way to send out data to another user, or terminal. Here is whatyou will want to type to create a file to anger the other user.$[ed beep]0*[a][echo ^G ^G ^G ^G Wheee!!! ^G ^G ^G >> /dev/xxxx][nohup beep &][^C]*[w]25*[q]$[chmod +r+w+x beep]$[nohup beep &]8002$  Fill in the '/dev/xxxx' with the terminal you want to annoy. To find outthe terminal of the person you want to fuck over, type 'who' it will print out something like this....$[who]guest    ttyd0   Nov 30 19:06root     console Nov 30 19:20Bendover ttyd5   Nov 30 18:45$  The first column is the name of the user, the second column tells us what terminal they are logged on as, and the third states at what time they logged on. The second column is what we need right now. Fill in thex's with the terminal that you wish. If you wanted to bother the root, youwould type '/dev/console', to bother guest type '/dev/ttyd0'. To bothermore than one terminal, just add another line after the first 'echo' statement with a different terminal identifier. With the 'nohup' command,the computer will send a continuous outpouring of beeps until he logs offor reboots the system. Try it on the terminal you are logged on under tosee exactly what it does. ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄIV - Conclusion  These projects should be enough to get you started on your road to UnixHell. With a little experience you will be able to think of new ideas thatwill alloy you access to the systems hidden features and assets. I willrelease other files on Unix in the near future, possibly one on basic Unixhacking, FTP, UUCP netting, or any number of other Unix related concepts.If you are interested in learning more on Unix, you can contact me on the systems at the top of the file. Thus concludes one dark Kryptic Night...V - Bibliography and Suggested ReadingUnix Use and Security From the Ground Up: by the Prophet in 1986         This is probably the BEST file I've ever seen on the subject         of Unix. It is written for the beginner, and contains valuable         information for the advanced user. The Prophet became a member          of Lod/H and is currently serving a sentence of 20 months in         relation to the big Lod/H bust of '90.        Articles on unix trojans and mischief: by Shooting Shark         Shooting Shark presents some interesting information         on various ways to commit havoc on Unix systems.         You can find most of his essays in both Phrack and Lod         magazines.Lod/H Tech Journals         The Legion of Doom/Hackers are perhaps the most skilled         and knowledgable hackers in the underground society.         Their 'Tech Journals' describe almost anything you'd ever         want to know about illegal activities. Phrack Magazines         Phrack is also one of the best sources for information on         a multitude of subjects, ranging from social engineering,          to carding, to making explosives. For those with free time,         download all of the 32 articles released to date.         Creating Users on Unix 	 This was my second text file release. It tells how to	 create new users on a Unix system using the root account. 	 It is told for beginner and advanced hacker alike.VI - GreetsHeh, Data Kult, when you gettin' Kelsea's phone number?Bounty Hunter, cool new software, hope you can work out the bugs.Lord Logics, ega STILL?
