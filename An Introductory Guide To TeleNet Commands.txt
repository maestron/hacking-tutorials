                   An Introductory Guide To TeleNet Commands
     I don't know how many of you use TeleNet to call this system (or other
systems) but I thought this might come in handy for those that do.
     Some basic info about TeleNet commands.  To enter a TeleNet you must be at
the TeleNet prompt "@".  You can get there two ways:
1)  When you first dial TeleNet you will be at the prompt
2)  When connected to a system via TeleNet you can return to TeleNet
    command mode by typing "<CR>@<CR>" (See note A.)
     Once you get to the prompt here are some of the commands available to you
and a brief description of what they do.
 Command           Function
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 C xxxxxxx<CR>     Connects you to a specific host or terminal.
 STAT<CR>          Display network port address.
 FULL<CR>          Set full duplex
 HALF<CR>          Set half duplex
 DTAPE<CR>         Prepares the network for bulk file transfers.
 CONT<CR>          Return to transfer mode from command mode.
 BYE<CR> or D<CR>  Disconnects you from the currently connected host.
 HANGUP<CR>        Tells TeleNet to hang up the phone....
 TERM xx<CR>       Changes your terminal type.  xx can be one of the
                   following:
                             D1  =  CRT's and Personal Computers
                             B3  =  Bi-directional printers
                             A2  =  Uni-directional printers
                             A5  =  Slow printing terminal which
                                    loses data on the left side
                                    at another setting.
                             A9  =  same as A5
                            <CR> =  Unknown
 MAIL or           Requests connection to Telemail.

 TEST CHAR<CR>     Used to test the system if you are receiving
                   garbled output.  Use this and look for garbled
