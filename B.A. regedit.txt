ok m8s,
any of you that do websites and like to open .html and similar files in notepad to edit scrpits, this is THE coolest windows registry edit ever
you can download the zip file with the .reg in it (run it and it automatically adds itself to your registry) or do it manually
CODE
http://www.geocities.com/ichbindeingott5/winXP-Notepad.zip


Manually: regedit and navigate to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\*\Shell
add the key "notepad"
it's default value should be "Open with Notepad"
now, under "notepad", add the key "Command"
it's default value should be (with the quotes) "C:\Windows\System32\Notepad.exe" "%1"

ok, exit regedit and go right click on ANY file...
your new option: Open with Notepad

HOW BADASS IS THAT?!?!?!?
I FOUND THIS ONE ON MY OWN!!!!!!

i know this one works on XP and 2000, you can PROBABLY enter it manually on windows 9x, but i have not tested that


okay okay, i know maybe not everyone cares...but this was fun for me because i love tweaking my computer AND it makes some web design stuff eaiser for me :D
