The information you can get from this system is great, but there arelimitations. Don't expect to be able to find a certain persons information,when hacking on this system you go for anyones account you can find, there isNO WAY you can find a certain persons account. The reason being, one the personmust have requested to have the Home Banking service. The second being you haveto have that persons last 9 digits on their versatel card. So as you can seethe chances are against you finding a certian person. The uses of this systemare still many if you are a carder. You can get a persons Visa and Master Cardnumbers. Once you have these you may card an Item and then pay it off. I willgo into further details following the intro. Connecting With the System-------------------------- To connect with the Bank's computer call your local Tymnet service and typethe following: PLEASE ENTER YOUR TERMINAL IDENTIFIER: APLEASE LOGIN: HOMEBANKLA              HOMEBANKSF For a little information about the login, as far as I have done is checked myarea and in California the two biggest closest cities to where I live isSan Francisco & Los Angeles. Which is the ending SF & LA. Listed below are aFEW of the other abreviations for the other states.-Alaska-AN-Anchorage                  :   Maryland-BM-BaltamoreAlabama-MT-Montgomery                :   Maine-PT-PortlandArkansas-LR-Little Rock              :   Michigan-AA-Ann ArborArizona-PH-Phoenix                   :            BC-Battle CreekBritish Columbia-PG-Prince George    :   Minnesota-MN-MinneapolisCalifonia-LA-Los Angeles             :   Missouri-CB-Columbia          SF-San Francisco           :   Mississippi-JK-Jackson          LB-Long Beach              :   Montana-BL-BillingsColorado-DN-Denver                   :   North Carolina-HP-High PointConnecticut-BP-Bridgeport            :   North Dakota-GF-Grand ForksDistrict of Columbia-WA-Washington   :   Nebraska-GI-Grand IslandDelaware-NW-NewarkWilming            :   New Hampshire-CN-ConcordFlorida-BR-Boca Raton                :   New Jersey-AC-Atlantic CityHawaii-HN-Honolulu                   :   New Mexico-AB-AlbuquerqueIowa-DM-Des Moines                   :   Nevada-LV-Las VegasIdaho-BO-Boise                       :   New York-DP-Deer ParkIllinois-CH-Chicago                  :   Oklahoma-OC-Oklahoma CityIndiana-FW-Ft. Wayne                 :   Pennsylvania-PI-PitsburghKansas-KC-Kansas City                :   Texas-DL-DallasKentucky-BG-Bowling Green            :   Virginia-FF-FairfaxMassachusetts-BT-Boston              :   Washington-SE-Seatle- Connection Established---------------------- After you have connected with the system you will get the following prompts: HOST CONNECTED:ID#: The Identification number is a ")" followed by the last nine digits of someonesversatel card. The first two digits in a zone are ALWAYS the same. These firsttwo digits are like the area codes for a Versatel Card. The easiest way to findout what the two numbers for your area are is look at your parents or your card.After you have gotten the first two digits least that lower the nine digit codedown to seven. The ID# is what I have found the hardest to get a hold of. Soonce you have that all your troubles are over! PASSCODE: This is alot easier to get than the ID# like on most systems that have usersthat are not aware of the dangers of having a code that is obvious, this systemalso has unskilled people using it. The passwords are VERY easy to guess. Theonly thing that makes it a little harder for hacking is they do not echo thecharacre is one quick way around that, HALF DUPLEX. Here are two ID#'s and Passcodes that I have hacked, please use them sparinglyand dont do any major damage.    ID#   :     PASSCODE)694532344: VERTELL)692313425: MAXCREDIT Benifits of B of A Over TRW--------------------------- On this system not only can you cedit their credit information after you haveit and card an Item you can scramble their funds around and they will NEVERknow what hit them. The best thing to do is wait for three days after you havecarded the item, then call the system and pay the item off and then trnasfertheir funds from their checking to their Credit Card and vise versa and thengo into the savings and throw that money were ever. It works great becauseafter they get everything straight agian they will notice some money gone,blame it on the bank and never think of out side "help". Main Menu Commands------------------ Here is what you can expect to find once you login to the system:            COMMAND LIST           ------------         1-MAIN MENU         2-PAY BILLS         3-TRANSFER FUNDS         4-BALANCE INQUIRY         5-REVIEW OR CANCLE         6-ELECTRONIC STATEMENT         7-ELECTRONIC MAIL         8-LOG OFF The Following commands can be entered at any "?" prompt and do the following:          ?-COMMAND LIST         Q-RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU         B-BEGIN FUNCTION AGIAN         P-NEXT PAGE DOWNLOADED FROM P-80 SYSTEMS......
